If the module needs to be deployed separately, a deployment document must be provided; otherwise, it may not be necessary.

The deployment document should include the deployment process, deployment configurations, uninstallation steps, etc. If the content of the deployment document is extensive, it may be converted into a directory, and then split into multiple documents for introduction.

You can visit [Deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding document.
