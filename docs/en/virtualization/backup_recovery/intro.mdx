1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and expected use cases, offering readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We typically determine whether to include the Introduction, Advantages, and Functional Overview sections in a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into standalone documents; for a single functional module, they can be combined into one document.

2. Importance of Introduction

There may be many aspects involved in a product or functional module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Provide a consistent understanding at the outset, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Offer readers a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: Minimize the time spent on repeated explanations of basic product knowledge.

3. How to Conceptualize this Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Use simple language to summarize the core points of the product, avoiding lengthiness.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functionalities of the product.
- Reader-Oriented: Consider the background of the target readers and provide the information they care about.

4. Special Features of Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. By organizing content structurally and using clear expression, it helps teams better convey the functional value of the product and enables users to quickly comprehend and utilize product features.

We will find some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introduction

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included within the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are broader and need to be explained together based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introduction

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the features and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Apart from the introduction, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be presented independently.

This is a brief description. It specifically introduces the expected purpose of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module based on Kubernetes, designed for cloud-native applications. It is the core of ACP, built on a native multi-cluster architecture that decouples the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments. This significantly simplifies the process of deploying applications in the cloud for enterprises and effectively reduces operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can conveniently create Kubernetes clusters and quickly establish an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
