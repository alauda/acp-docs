:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Concepts introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding sections in the "Core Concepts" chapter below. If the introduced concept is relatively simple and does not require a separate documentation introduction, it can be briefly explained within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to provide a more thorough explanation.

You can access the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view illustrative documents.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams regarding this functionality. The diagrams may contain the following content:

- Core Components: For example, Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., illustrating the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: Such as the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process through which resources are consumed, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: For example, multi-cluster deployments, high availability designs, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram explaining the image's meaning and the role of each part within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in "Core Concepts."
