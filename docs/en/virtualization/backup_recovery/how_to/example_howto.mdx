1. Overview

HowTo documents are practical technical documents focused on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. They combine product features with real-world use cases to provide users with comprehensive solution guidance.

2. Document Features

HowTo documents have the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: providing end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios.
- Highly practical: directly answering the question "how to achieve a specific goal", with an emphasis on practical operational guidance.
- Completeness: covering the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
- Replicability: users can replicate the solutions in similar scenarios by following the documented steps.

3. Writing Preparation

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify the specific needs and pain points of users.
- Determine the applicability of the solution.
- Evaluate implementation conditions and potential limitations.

Audience Targeting

- Identify the target readers (e.g., developers, operations staff, system administrators, etc.).
- Assess the technical background and knowledge level of the readers.
- Understand the work scenarios and environments of the readers.

# \<HowTo Title: Starts with a General Verb\>

> Feature name; if the purpose is very strong, it's advisable to clarify the task objective and start with a verb, for example: Connect to Cluster / Upgrade Cluster

## Feature Overview

> There is no fixed introductory paradigm, but you can consider aspects such as what it is, use cases, and intended purpose when thinking about this feature.

## Use Cases

> Think about this feature (what it is, use cases, intended purpose, etc.)

## Preconditions

> Outline the preparatory work or necessary conditions before formally using this feature. An ordered list is recommended.

Before using the feature, ensure:

- Condition 1
- Condition 2
- ......

## Operating Steps

> Provide specific operational steps for using this feature. If necessary, provide "Tips," "Notes," or "Warnings" information under the relevant steps.

Use the feature by following these steps:

1. Step 1

> For the description of the steps, it is recommended to use clear executable steps, such as: Scale the Deployment's replica count to 3, as opposed to using overly vague expressions like: Increase the number of instances.

2. Step 2
3. ......

Parameter descriptions are as follows:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ |
|        |        |
|        |        |
|        |        |

## Operational Results

> Describe how to verify whether the task has been successfully completed. This section can be deleted if the title is already sufficiently directive.

## Learn More

> If there are many extensions related to this scenario or feature usage, you can provide users with additional information related to this task here.

## Follow-up Actions

> If any, outline the follow-up tasks after completing this task and hyperlink to related documents.
