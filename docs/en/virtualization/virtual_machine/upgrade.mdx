:::tip

If the parent module requires manual intervention for the upgrade process, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade procedure, upgrade configuration, rollback procedure, and other relevant information.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade procedures between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide," "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can access the [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for examples of the corresponding documents.
