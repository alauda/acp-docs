:::tip
The purpose of writing a "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Any "concepts" introduced in the architecture are recommended to be linked to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" mentioned later. If the "concept" introduced is relatively simple and does not require a separate document for explanation, it can be briefly described within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory, to provide a more detailed explanation.

You can access the [architecture document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view a sample document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to the functionality. The diagrams may include the following content:

- Core components: such as Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., illustrating the relationships and functions of each component in the diagram.
- Data flow: including introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process by which resources are consumed.
- Deployment architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram to explain the meaning of the image and the role of each part within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts."
