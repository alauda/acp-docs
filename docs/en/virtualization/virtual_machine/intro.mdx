1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening for product documentation or feature modules, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It encompasses core concepts, primary functions, target users, and intended uses, giving readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We generally decide whether to include the Introduction, Advantages, and Feature Overview sections in a document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents. For single feature modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. The Importance of an Introduction

Given the numerous aspects that a product or feature module may involve, adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Provides a consistent recognition, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Offers a clear product background for readers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: Reduces the time spent on repeated explanations of fundamental product knowledge.

3. How to Construct the Introduction Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functions of the product.
- Audience-Focused: Consider the background of the target readers and provide the information they care about.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing feature modules in documents. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better communicate the product's functional value, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize the product's features.

There are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive and need to be described in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by a single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> In addition to this introduction, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This is a short description. Specifically, it introduces the expected uses of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decouples the underlying infrastructure, achieves unified management of multi-cloud and multi-cluster, significantly simplifies the process of migrating applications to the cloud, and effectively reduces operational management and labor costs. Through container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
