Introduce common issues users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is minimal, it can be placed directly on a single page titled "Troubleshooting." If the content is more extensive, create a "Troubleshooting" directory, with each issue documented separately.

You can access the [troubleshooting document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to see a corresponding document example.

# \<Title: Generally the Name of the Issue>

## Issue Description

Provide a detailed account of the environment in which the issue occurs, the scope of its impact, and the symptoms of the problem. Additionally, augment this with the following auxiliary information as appropriate:

- Problem Screenshots: It is currently recommended to use text descriptions primarily; if the text cannot adequately describe the issue, users should use screenshots and register discussions with the documentation team.
- Related Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have been verified to lead to the problem (these can be either a single definite cause or multiple plausible causes). Each cause needs to meet the following conditions:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and been proven to lead to the problem, rather than a speculative or imaginary cause.
2. A detailed causal analysis must be provided, including:
   - How this cause triggers the problem.
   - The specific mechanism and process through which the problem occurs.

## Issue Diagnosis (Optional)

Detail specific steps for diagnosing the issue. This process allows users to select the most likely or certain cause among multiple possibilities and to apply appropriate solutions to address the problem. When diagnosing the issue, pay attention to:

- If there is only one root cause, diagnostic steps must be provided, preferably in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Diagnostic Step 1
  ...
  n. Diagnostic Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with differing diagnostic steps, each root cause should be listed under its respective third-level heading, with detailed diagnostic steps provided beneath each one.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Diagnostic Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnostic Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Diagnostic Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnostic Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is how to write the title for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be “Solution”)

Specific considerations, prerequisites, and operational steps for solving the problem.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the name of the second-level title should be “Solution”; if there are multiple root causes with different solutions, each solution should have a separate second-level title, named “Solution for Root Cause 1,” “Solution for Root Cause N,” etc.

### Considerations (Optional)

Points to note before beginning the operations; failure to read this section carefully may result in operational failures or even more severe consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that must be met before beginning operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level title can be omitted if there are no considerations or prerequisites)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list; if the steps are complex, additional headings may be required for differentiation, in which case fourth-level headings can be used to list each step, with specific steps under each one presented in an ordered list.
- For operations carried out on a container platform, detailed steps for each operation can be fully enumerated; for operations on a third-party platform or other software, only the relevant key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For operations not conducted on a container platform, excessive detail may hinder our ability to update documentation promptly in response to interface changes, potentially leading to problems. To ensure the long-term usability of the documentation, the description of operational steps for third-party platforms should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Emphasize core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain the generality and flexibility of operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure the user understands the purpose of the operation and the basic process involved.

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is how to write the title for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be removed)

The content here is consistent with the solution format for Root Cause 1 and will not be repeated.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures (recommendations, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.) to prevent the issue from occurring again.

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can hold content used in the document that is not convenient to place in the main body, such as tool usage instructions, reference materials, etc.
