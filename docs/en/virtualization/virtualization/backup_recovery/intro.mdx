# Introduction

**ACP Virtualization With Kubevirt** provides virtual machine snapshot capabilities, allowing users to back up and restore VMs via snapshots.

## Application Scenarios

- Disaster Recovery & Failure Rollback
 
  When a virtual machine experiences data loss due to hardware failures, human errors (e.g., accidental file deletion), or malicious attacks (e.g., ransomware), snapshots serve as the last line of defense to restore operations.

## Usage Limitations

- Creating a snapshot requires stopping the virtual machine first.
- The PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) used by the virtual machine disk must be configured with a multi-node shared access mode.
