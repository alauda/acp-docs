When writing feature documentation, the person in charge of each feature should reasonably split the document pages and directory structure according to the characteristics of the specific feature. Prioritize providing the corresponding CLI operation instructions to allow users to get started quickly.

1. Overview

Feature guideline documentation typically resides between feature overview and HowTo documents, focusing on a detailed introduction of a single feature. It can include a detailed description of the feature itself.

2. Core Characteristics

Feature guideline documentation should possess the following core characteristics:

- Conceptual Orientation: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the feature.
- Flexibility: Description of the feature can be independent of specific scenarios.
- CLI Details: Prioritize providing detailed command line operation instructions to help users quickly implement the feature via CLI. Follow this with supplementary information about the usage of the feature in the user interface.

3. Differences Between Feature Documentation and HowTo Documentation

Feature documentation often includes some introductions to feature usage and operations, but the differences between it and HowTo can often be confusing for us. Their distinctions lie in:

- **Content Focus**
  - Feature Guidelines: Answer "what is it" and "why," helping users understand the feature itself.
  - HowTo: Answer "how to," guiding users to complete specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Feature Guidelines: A systematic and hierarchical knowledge system focusing on conceptual explanations and principle elucidation.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear operation steps emphasizing practical guidance.

- **Usage Scenario**
  - Feature Guidelines: When users are first getting to know the feature or need to understand the underlying principles in depth.
  - HowTo: When users need to solve specific problems or accomplish specific tasks.

- **Coverage Scope**
  - Feature Guidelines: A complete introduction of all characteristics, configuration options, and usage methods of the feature.
  - HowTo: Specific operation guidelines for a single scenario or task.

4. Writing Guidelines

When writing feature documentation, particularly regarding the CLI section, it is recommended to follow these steps:

- Identify the target user group: Determine the target audience of the document and their needs. Understand their familiarity with CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content.
- Structure the content: Divide the document into multiple parts, such as feature overview, CLI command parameter details, usage examples, and notes. Ensure each section is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed command explanation: For each CLI command, provide detailed parameter descriptions and usage examples. Explain the command's functions, applicable scenarios, and potential output results.
