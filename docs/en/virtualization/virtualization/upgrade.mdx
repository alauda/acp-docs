:::tip

If the parent module requires manual intervention for the upgrade process, an upgrade document should be provided; otherwise, it is not necessary.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade procedure, upgrade configuration, rollback procedure, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade procedures between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized as a directory and include separate upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view an example of the corresponding document.
