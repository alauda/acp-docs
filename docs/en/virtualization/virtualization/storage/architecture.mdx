:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

It is recommended to link to the corresponding sections of "Core Concepts" for any "concepts" introduced in the architecture. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require separate documentation, they can be briefly explained within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to draft a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory for a more comprehensive introduction.

You can visit the [Architectural Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view an example document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to the functionality. The diagram can include the following content:

- Core Components: such as Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., and illustrate the connections and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: such as the introduced resources, the dependencies between resources, and the flow of resource consumption, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram that explains the meaning of the image and the roles of its various parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts."
