1. Overview

HowTo documentation is a practice-oriented technical document that focuses on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. It combines product functionality with practical application scenarios to provide users with comprehensive solution guidance.

2. Document Features

HowTo documentation has the following core features:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios
- Highly practical: Directly addresses the question of "how to achieve a certain goal," emphasizing practical operational guidance
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation
- Replicability: Users can replicate the solution in similar scenarios by following the steps in the document

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write HowTo documentation, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify users' specific needs and pain points
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution
- Evaluate implementation conditions and possible constraints

Audience Targeting

- Identify the target readers (e.g., developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.)
- Assess readers' technical background and knowledge level
- Understand the readers' working scenarios and environment

# \<HowTo Title: General Verb Start\>

> Function name; if the purpose is strong, it is recommended to clarify the task goal and use a verb to start, for example: Accessing Cluster / Upgrading Cluster

## Function Overview

> There is no fixed introduction pattern, but you can think about what it is, usage scenarios, usage purposes, etc. for this function.

## Usage Scenarios

> Consider this function (what it is, usage scenarios, usage purposes, etc.)

## Prerequisites

> Describe the preparatory work or necessary conditions before using this function formally. An ordered list is recommended.

Before using the function, ensure:

- Condition 1
- Condition 2
- ......

## Steps to Operate

> Provide specific operational steps for using this function. If necessary, provide "Tips," "Notes," or "Warnings" underneath relevant steps.

Follow the steps below to use the function:

1. Step 1
