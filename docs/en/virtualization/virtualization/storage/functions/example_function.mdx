When writing feature documentation, responsible individuals for each feature should reasonably divide document pages and directory structures based on the specific characteristics of the features. Prioritize providing operation instructions for the corresponding CLI to help users get started quickly.

1. Overview

Feature guide documents typically reside between feature overviews and HowTo documents, focusing on detailed introductions to single features. It can encompass detailed descriptions of the feature itself.

2. Core Features

Feature guide documents should possess the following core features:

- Concept-Oriented: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the feature.
- Flexibility: Feature descriptions can be made without relying on specific scenarios.
- Detailed CLI Explanation: Prioritize providing detailed command-line operation instructions to help users quickly implement features through the CLI. Supplement with the usage of the corresponding feature interface.

3. Differences Between Feature Documents and HowTo Documents

Feature documents often include some introductions to feature usage and operations, but the differences from HowTo can often be confusing for us. The differences are as follows:

- **Content Focus**
  - Feature Guide: Answers "what is it" and "why," helping users understand the feature itself.
  - HowTo: Answers "how to do it," guiding users to complete specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Feature Guide: A systematic, hierarchical knowledge system that emphasizes concept explanations and principle clarifications.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear operation steps that focus on practical guidance.

- **Use Cases**
  - Feature Guide: When users initially learn about the feature or need a deeper understanding of its principles.
  - HowTo: When users need to solve specific problems or complete specific tasks.

- **Coverage**
  - Feature Guide: Complements all characteristics, configuration items, and usage methods of the feature.
  - HowTo: Specific operation guidance for a single scenario or task.

4. Writing Guidelines

When crafting feature documents, especially those involving CLI, it is recommended to follow these steps:

- Define the target user group: Identify the intended audience of the document and their needs. Understand their familiarity with the CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content.
- Structure the content: Divide the document into several sections, such as feature introduction, CLI command parameter details, usage examples, and notes. Ensure that each section is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed Command Explanation: For each CLI command, provide detailed parameter descriptions and usage examples. Explain the command's function, applicable scenarios, and possible output results.
