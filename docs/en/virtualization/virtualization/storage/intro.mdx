# Introduction

ACP Virtualization with KubeVirt Storage provides persistent storage capabilities for virtual machines (VMs) by seamlessly integrating with Kubernetes-native storage mechanisms. It leverages **PersistentVolumeClaim** (PVC) to store VM disk data and utilizes the **Container Storage Interface** (CSI) to integrate with various storage systems. Additionally, the **Containerized Data Importer** (CDI) is employed to initialize VM disk data. Building on these foundations, the platform extends advanced functionalities for VM disk management, enabling comprehensive lifecycle control.

## Advantages

- User-Friendly Operations

  Most VM disk operations can be easily performed via the **Web UI**, minimizing the need for CLI expertise.

- VM Disk Lifecycle Management

  Configure whether VM disks should be automatically deleted when the associated VM is terminated.
