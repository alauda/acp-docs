1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and intended use, offering readers a clear initial understanding.

Typically, we will decide whether to combine the introduction, advantages, and feature overview sections into a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be merged into the same document.

2. Importance of Introduction

The aspects involved in a product or functional module can be numerous. Adding an introduction at the outset can:

- Unified Understanding: Provides a consistent perception from the beginning, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Offers a clear product background for readers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: Reduces the time spent on repetitive explanations of the product's basic concepts.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main features.
- Reader-Oriented: Consider the background of the target readers and provide information that concerns them.

4. Unique Aspects of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. By organizing content structurally and expressing it clearly, it helps the team better convey the product function's value, allowing users to quickly understand and utilize the product features.

We will find some differences between product-level and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position and competitive advantages in the industry.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive and need to be explained jointly based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the features and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by a single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Beyond the content of this introduction section, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can also be separated out.

This is a short description. Specifically introduce the expected use of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure to achieve unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster, significantly simplifying enterprises' application cloud migration processes, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can conveniently create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
