Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be merged into a single document for multiple concepts. Conversely, if the concepts are more complex, it is recommended to dedicate a separate document for each concept. For obscure and complex concepts, it is advisable to create a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more accessible introduction.

You can access the [concept document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to view corresponding document examples.
