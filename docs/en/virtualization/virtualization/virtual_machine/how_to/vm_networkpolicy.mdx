# Control Virtual Machine Network Requests Through Network Policy

The platform's virtual machine solution is implemented based on the open-source component KubeVirt, which actually runs within Pods. By utilizing the functionality of Network Policies, it is possible to control the incoming and outgoing requests of virtual machines.

## Operation Steps

1. Enter **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network** > **Network Policies**.

3. Click **Create Network Policy**.

4. Configure the following parameters as needed.

   | Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Association Method** | <ul><li>**Compute Component**: Select the target compute component as needed; it is recommended to select **All** as the target compute component.</li><li>**Label Selector**: Match the Pods based on their labels.</li></ul>                                                                              |
   | **Direction**   | <ul><li>**Ingress**: Requests sent from the external to the Pod.</li><li>**Egress**: Requests sent from the Pod to the external; select this option if prohibiting the virtual machine from requesting a certain external address.</li></ul>                                                                                 |
   | **Protocol**    | Choose between TCP or UDP.<br /><br />**Note**: <ul><li>When using domain names in the virtual machine to request external services, it is necessary to add a UDP protocol whitelist because DNS protocol uses UDP.</li><li>The form does not support configuring the ICMP protocol; once the whitelist rules are enabled, ICMP protocol will be disabled, which will result in the inability to perform Ping operations.</li></ul> |
   | **Access Ports** | Specify which ports' traffic can be ingress or egress. If this field is left empty, traffic through all ports will be allowed by default.<br /><br />**Note**: It is necessary to allow ports 1053 and 53 for both UDP and TCP protocols here to permit DNS traffic egress; otherwise, domain name resolution will fail.                                                       |
   | **Remote Type**  | Specify the allowed remote types for access. Options include: compute component, namespace, and IP segments.                                                                                                                                            |
   | **Exclude Remote** | When the remote type is **IP Segment**, remove the specified IP from the whitelist (i.e., prohibit access). Single IP can be removed when input as `IP/32`.<br /><br />**Note**: This field only supports inputting IPs; if the corresponding IP of a domain name is unclear, use the command `curl -vvv <domain>` to request the domain and obtain the corresponding IP address from the returned information.           |

5. Click **Create**.

## Result Verification

This document verifies the setup using a virtual machine to access [www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

### Step One: Create a Virtual Machine and Network Policy Allowing All Traffic Through\{#one}

1. Create the virtual machine, please refer to [Create Virtual Machine](../functions/create_virtual_machine.mdx) for detailed steps.

2. Configure the network policy in the command namespace of the virtual machine, adding whitelist rules for both TCP and UDP protocols, with the following parameters:

   - Whitelist for TCP Protocol:

     | Parameter         | Description                           |
     | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
     | **Association Method**   | Select **Compute Component**.                 |
     | **Target Compute Component** | Select **All**.                   |
     | **Direction**     | Select **Egress**.                   |
     | **Protocol**      | Select **TCP**.                      |
     | **Remote Type**   | Select **IP Segment**                  |
     | **Remote**       | Enter **0.0.0.0/0**, indicating that all traffic is allowed to egress. |

   - Whitelist Rules for UDP Protocol:

     | Parameter       | Description                           |
     | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
     | **Direction**   | Select **Egress**.                   |
     | **Protocol**    | Select **UDP**.                      |
     | **Remote Type** | Select **IP Segment**                  |
     | **Remote**      | Enter **0.0.0.0/0**, indicating that all traffic is allowed to egress. |

3. After the network policy is created, log in to the virtual machine and execute the following command to request [www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

   ```
   curl www.example.com
   ```

4. The request is successful.

### Step Two: Update Network Policy to Remove [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) from Whitelist

1. Execute the following command to obtain the IP address for [www.example.com](http://www.example.com), resulting in the IP address 93.184.215.14.

   ```
   curl -vvv www.example.com
   ```

2. Update the network policy created in [Step One](#one), with the following updated parameters:

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                          |
   | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Exclude Remote** | In the TCP protocol whitelist rules, fill in the exclude remote parameter with 93.184.215.14/32, indicating that IP address 93.184.215.14 is removed from the whitelist. |

3. After updating the network policy, log in to the virtual machine and execute the following command to request [www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

   ```
   curl www.example.com
   ```

4. The request times out, indicating that the exclude remote functionality is effective.
