# Creating Virtual Machines/Virtual Machine Groups

Create a virtual machine (VirtualMachineInstance) using an image, and schedule the virtual machine to physical nodes with Kubevirt components installed and virtualization enabled.

You can create a single virtual machine through [Create Virtual Machine](#virtual), or you can quickly create multiple virtual machines (VirtualMachineInstance) with the same configuration by using [Create Virtual Machine Group](#virtual_group) (virtualMachinePool).

## Prerequisites

- Before creating a virtual machine using an image, please confirm the following with the platform administrator:

  - The target cluster is a self-built cluster, and the Kubevirt components have been deployed.

  - The target node must be a physical node with virtualization enabled.

  - A virtual machine image has been added to the platform.

- If you need to use the physical GPU passthrough feature of the virtual machine, please contact the platform administrator for the following configuration:

  1. Obtain GPU passthrough environment preparation plan and prepare the necessary environment.

  2. Prepare the required physical GPU and enable the related features for physical GPU passthrough for the virtual machine.

## Notes

When using Windows virtual machines, only logins via the **username/password** set in the virtual machine image are supported. Please contact the platform administrator to obtain this information in advance.

### Operating Steps

**Note**: The following content presents an example of creating a virtual machine using a form, and you may also switch to YAML format for the operation.

1. Enter **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Virtualization** > **Virtual Machines**.

3. Click **Create Virtual Machine**.

4. In the **Basic Information** area, fill in the name and display name of the virtual machine and set tags or annotations.

   | Parameter                | Description                                                                 |
   | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Tags**            | Used to select objects and find collections of objects that meet certain criteria. Must be a key-value pair, for example: *app.kubernetes.io/name: hello-app*. |
   | **Annotations**     | Used to provide any information to development and operations teams. Must be a key-value pair, for example: *cpaas.io/maintainer: kim*.              |

5. Set the machine type and choose a virtual machine image.

   | Parameter                | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Specifications**      | You can select recommended usage scenarios or custom resource limits based on your needs.                                                                                                                                                     |
   | **Physical GPU (Alpha)** | Select the model of the physical GPU; only one physical GPU can be allocated to each virtual machine. <br /><br />**Note**: Physical GPU passthrough for the virtual machine refers to the direct allocation of the actual Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to the virtual machine in a virtualization environment, enabling it to directly access and utilize the physical GPU to achieve graphical performance equivalent to running directly on a physical machine, avoiding performance bottlenecks caused by virtual graphics adapters and enhancing overall performance. |
   | **Image**            | Choose a public image that has been assigned to the platform project by the platform administrator. <br />**Note**: Only supports selecting images with the same **CPU architecture** as the cluster architecture.                                                                                                                  |

6. In the **Storage** area, refer to the following instructions to configure the relevant information.

   \| Parameter             | Description                                   |
   \| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   \| **Disk Name**       | The name of the storage disk; the system disk name cannot be modified.|
   \| **Type**         | <ul><li>**Root Disk**: The system automatically creates a VirtIO type rootfs system disk to store the operating system and data.</li><li>**Data Disk**: Click to add multiple data disks for persistent data storage. Defaults to VirtIO device.</li></ul>**Note**: Data disk names must not duplicate existing disk names. |
   \| **Volume Mode**       | <ul><li>**File System**: Mount the disk as a mounted file directory.</li><li>**Block Device**: Mount the disk as a block device.</li></ul> |
   \| **Storage Class**       | The platform maintains virtual machine disks by creating and managing persistent volume claims. You need to specify a storage class required for dynamically creating persistent volume claims. <br />Different storage classes support different volume modes; if there is no available storage class for the selected volume mode, please contact an administrator for addition. |
   \| **Capacity**         | The capacity required for the virtual machine storage; the minimum for the system disk is 20 G.|
   \| **Delete with VM** | Defaults to enabled, cannot be modified, indicating that the disk data will also be deleted when the virtual machine is deleted. |

7. In the **Network** area, refer to the following instructions to configure the relevant information.

   \| Parameter         | Description                                      |
   \| ---------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   \| **IP Address**  | <ul><li>Defaults to **Dynamic (DHCP)**; an IP is dynamically assigned when the virtual machine starts, and the IP is released when the virtual machine stops.</li><li>If binding a **Static IP**, the virtual machine will always use this IP address even after a restart. If there are no available IPs in the current project, please release an IP appropriately first.</li></ul> |
   \| **Network Mode** | <ul><li>**Bridged**: The virtual machine shares the same IP address as the container group and communicates externally through this IP address.</li><li>**NAT**: The virtual machine will be assigned an internal IP address but will translate to the container group IP address for external communication. Open ports indicate the exposed ports of the virtual machine, such as the SSH service port 22; not filling in **Open Ports** indicates that all ports are open.</li></ul> |
   |**Auxiliary Network Card**|Add auxiliary network cards as needed. <br />**Note**:<ul><li>If auxiliary network card features are required or there are no available types of auxiliary network card networks, please contact the platform administrator for configuration.</li><li>SR-IOV types only support Linux operating systems on x86_64 architecture.</li><li>Defaults to obtaining IP addresses via DHCP.<li>After multiple reboots, SR-IOV virtual machines may exhibit two different VFs but with the same MAC address.</li></li></ul>|

8. In the **Initialization Settings** area, refer to the following instructions to configure the relevant information.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Keys**   | Always use SSH keys for remote login verification. This method does not require password validation; it is recommended to log in to the virtual machine using keys. <ul><li>You can use the keys already available in the platform or create new keys immediately; all relevant keys can be viewed on the **Virtualization > Key Pairs** page.</li><li>Only individuals with the private key can access the virtual machine via SSH. If multiple people are to maintain the virtual machine together, multiple keys can be associated, and private keys can be assigned to different users. If key leakage occurs, the associated key can be promptly revoked to reduce damage.</li><li>The public key of the SSH key is stored in the platform in a confidential form; the platform does not store your private key, so please keep it safe by yourself.</li><li>Please consult the relevant operating system documentation for the root user password.</li></ul> |
   | **Password**   | Use the operating system user and password for login verification, which can still be updated to the key method later. <ul><li>The user is only an initial account; after the virtual machine is successfully created, you can also create other operating system users in the virtual machine for login.</li><li>The platform encrypts and stores your root user password, and you will not see its plaintext password again, so please keep it safe by yourself.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                     |
   | **Start Immediately** | Defaults to enabled. Enabling this option will start the virtual machine immediately after creation, otherwise only the virtual machine will be created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

9. (Optional) In the **Advanced Configuration** area, refer to the following instructions to configure the relevant information.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Health Check** | <ul><li>**Liveness Check**: Checks if the virtual machine is in a healthy state; if the detection result is abnormal, it will determine whether to restart the instance based on the health check configuration.</li><li>**Availability Check**: Checks if the virtual machine has completed startup and is in a normal service state; if the health status of the virtual machine instance is detected as abnormal, the state of the virtual machine will be updated.</li></ul><br />For related parameter descriptions. |
   | **Node Affinity** | <ul><li>**Preferred**: The virtual machine will be scheduled to nodes that meet affinity requirements whenever possible. The system will determine nodes capable of running the virtual machine by combining affinity weights and other scheduling requirements (e.g., compute resource requirements).</li><li>**Required**: The virtual machine will only be scheduled to nodes that fully meet affinity requirements.</li></ul>                                                                                                    |

10. After confirming that the information is correct, click **Create**.

    Wait for the virtual machine to change from **Creating** to **Running** status.

### Related Operations

You can click the ⋮ icon on the right side of the list page or the **Actions** in the upper right corner of the details page to update or delete the virtual machine as needed. For other related operations like resetting passwords or updating keys, please refer to [Manage Virtual Machines](./virtual_management.mdx).

**Note**:

- Updates can only be performed when the virtual machine is in **Abnormal**, **Unknown**, or **Stopped** status.

- Updates do not support displaying disks that were separately attached or created after the virtual machine was created.

- By default, **Start Immediately** is disabled during updates; you can enable it as needed.
