# Quick Location of Virtual Machines

The platform supports displaying the list of virtual machines by cluster, allowing platform administrators to quickly locate the namespace of the virtual machine and perform operations such as scaling up or troubleshooting, thereby improving operational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the virtualization feature is enabled for the current cluster before use. Please refer to [Install](../../installation.mdx).

## Procedure

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Virtualization Management** > **Virtual Machines**.

3. Select ***Cluster*** to view the list of virtual machines in that cluster.

4. You can quickly locate the virtual machine by its name, IP address, or creator.

5. Click on the virtual machine ***Name*** link to enter the details page of that virtual machine, where you can perform operations such as scaling up or troubleshooting.
