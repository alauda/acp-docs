# Managing Virtual Disks

Data disks can be used to meet the data persistence requirements of the business.

## Creating a Virtual Disk

Create a **data disk** for the virtual machine. Only **one** virtual disk can be added at a time; if multiple disks are needed, please repeat this operation.

**Note**: Virtual disks can be mounted online when the virtual machine is in **running** state.

### Steps

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Virtualization** > **Virtual Disk**.

3. Click on **Create Virtual Disk**.

4. Configure the information based on the following instructions.

   | Parameter     | Description                                                                                                        |
   | ----------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Volume Mode** | - **File System**: Mount the disk in a way that mounts the file directory.<br />- **Block Device**: Mount the disk as a block device.                   |
   | **Storage Class** | The platform maintains virtual machine disks by automatically creating and managing persistent volume claims. You need to specify the storage class required for dynamically creating persistent volume claims.<br /><br />Different storage classes support different volume modes. If there are no available storage classes for the selected volume mode, please contact the administrator for addition. |
   | **Delete with VM** | If enabled, the disk data will also be deleted when the virtual machine is deleted.                                                  |
   | **Mount**      | - **Do Not Mount**: Only create the virtual disk; it can be mounted later when needed.<br />- **Mount to VM**: Select the target virtual machine to which the virtual disk needs to be mounted. |

5. Click on **Create**.

## Mounting a Virtual Disk

Mount the **data disk** to a virtual machine, attaching the already created virtual disk to the target virtual machine.

**Note**: Virtual disks can be mounted online when the virtual machine is in **running** state.

### Steps

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Virtualization** > **Virtual Disk**.

3. Click ⋮ > **Mount** next to the virtual disk to be mounted.

4. Select the target virtual machine and click **Mount**.

## Expanding a Virtual Disk

Expand the **system disk** and **data disk** already mounted to the virtual machine.

### Steps

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Virtualization** > **Virtual Machine**.

3. Click the name of the virtual machine to enter the **Details** page.

4. In the **Virtual Disk** area, find the disk to be expanded and click ⋮ > **Expand**.

5. Enter the new capacity and click **Expand**.

## Unmounting a Virtual Disk

Unmount the **data disk** from the virtual machine; only virtual machines in the **stopped** state can unmount disks.

### Steps

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Virtualization** > **Virtual Disk**.

3. Click ⋮ > **Unmount** next to the virtual disk to be unmounted and confirm.

## Deleting a Virtual Disk

Deletion is only supported when the virtual disk is in an unmounted state.

**Note**: System disks cannot be deleted.

### Steps

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Virtualization** > **Virtual Disk**.

3. Click ⋮ > **Delete** next to the virtual disk to be deleted and confirm.
