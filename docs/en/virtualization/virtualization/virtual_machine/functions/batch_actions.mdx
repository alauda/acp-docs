# Batch Operations on Virtual Machines

Perform batch operations such as starting, stopping, restarting, and deleting virtual machines.

## Procedure

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. Click on **Virtualization** > **Virtual Machines** in the left navigation bar.

3. Locate the target virtual machine, click â‹® to perform operations on a single virtual machine, or refer to the image below for batch operations on virtual machines.

   **Note**:

   - The **Start/Batch Start** operation can be executed when the virtual machine is in a suspended or stopped state; the **Stop/Batch Stop** operation can be executed when the virtual machine is in a Preparing, Starting, Running, Suspended, Unknown, or Exception state; the **Restart/Batch Restart** operation can be executed when the virtual machine is in a Running state.

   - Performing a forced **Restart/Stop** operation on a virtual machine is equivalent to cutting off power to the virtual machine, which may result in loss of data that has not been written to disk.

4. Complete the operations according to the prompts on the interface. When the virtual machine changes to the states below, the operation is successful.

   | Operation          | Status  |
   | :------------------- | :------- |
   | **Start Virtual Machine** | Running |
   | **Stop Virtual Machine**  | Stopped |
   | **Restart Virtual Machine** | Running |
