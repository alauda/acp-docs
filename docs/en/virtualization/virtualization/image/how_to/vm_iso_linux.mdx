# Creating Linux Images Based on ISO Using KubeVirt

This document describes a virtual machine solution implemented based on the open-source component KubeVirt. It utilizes KubeVirt virtualization technology to create a Linux operating system image from an ISO image file.

## Prerequisites

- All components in the cluster are functioning properly.

- A Linux image should be prepared in advance. This document uses the [Ubuntu operating system](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu-releases/) as an example.

- A repository for storing images should be prepared in advance. This document uses the build-harbor.example.cn repository as an example; please replace it according to your actual environment.

## Constraints and Limitations

- When starting KubeVirt, the file system size of the custom image will affect the speed of writing the image to the PVC disk. If the file system is too large, it may result in a prolonged creation time.

- It is recommended to keep the Linux root partition size below 100G to minimize the initial size. After configuring cloud-init, allocate larger storage for the root partition when creating the virtual machine, and the system will automatically expand it.

## Procedure
<Steps>
### Convert Linux ISO Image into Docker Image

1. Navigate to the directory where the ISO image is stored and execute the following command in the terminal to rename the ISO image to ubuntu.iso.

   ```bash
   mv <ISO image name> ubuntu.iso # Replace <ISO image name> with the actual image name, e.g., mv ubuntu-24.04-live-server-amd64.iso ubuntu.iso
   ```

2. Create a Dockerfile by executing the following command.

   ```bash
   touch Dockerfile
   ```

3. Edit the Dockerfile, add the following content, and save it.

   ```docker
   FROM scratch
   ADD --chown=107:107 ubuntu.iso /disk/
   ```

4. Build the Docker image by executing the following command.

   ```bash
   docker build -t build-harbor.example.cn/3rdparty/vmdisks/ubuntu-iso:24.04 . # Please replace the repository according to your actual environment
   ```

5. Push the image to the repository by executing the following command.

   ```bash
   docker push build-harbor.example.cn/3rdparty/vmdisks/ubuntu-iso:24.04 # Please replace the repository according to your actual environment
   ```

### Create Virtual Machine

1. Enter the **Container Platform**.

2. Click **Virtualization** > **Virtual Machines** in the left navigation bar.

3. Click **Create Virtual Machine**.

4. Fill in the parameters on the form page as follows. For specific parameters and configurations, please refer to [Create Virtual Machine](/virtualization/virtualization/virtual_machine/functions/create_virtual_machine.mdx).

   | Parameter        | Description                                  |
   |------------------|----------------------------------------------|
   | **Select Image** | Choose the template image for the virtual machine. |
   | **IP Address**   | Keep default, which will be obtained via **DHCP**. |
   | **Network Mode** | Use **NAT** mode; do not use **bridged** mode here. |

5. Switch to YAML.

6. Replace the configuration under the spec.template.spec.domain.devices.disks field with the following content.

   ```yaml
         domain:
           devices:
             disks:
               - bootOrder: 1
                 cdrom:
                   bus: sata
                 name: containerdisk
               - disk:
                   bus: virtio
                 name: cloudinitdisk
               - disk:
                   bus: virtio
                 name: rootfs
                 bootOrder: 10
   ```

7. Add the following content under the spec.template.spec.volumes field.

   ```yaml
           - containerDisk:
               image: registry.example.cn:60070/3rdparty/vmdisks/ubuntu-iso:24.04 # Please replace the image according to your actual environment
             name: containerdisk
   ```

8. Review the YAML file; the complete YAML configuration after completion is as follows.

        - [xfs_growfs, /dev/vda1]  # The xfs_growfs command is used to extend the XFS file system to occupy all available space on the partition. /dev/vda1 is the partition where the file system to be extended is located. After extending the partition, using xfs_growfs ensures that the file system itself is also expanded to the new partition size.
      ```

   3. Save the configuration after modifications.

8. After completing the configuration, shut down the operating system.
