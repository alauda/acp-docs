Introduce common problems that users may encounter and solutions. If the content is brief, it can be placed directly on a single page titled "Problem Handling". If the content is extensive, create a directory with "Problem Handling" as the section and each problem as a separate document.

You can visit the [Problem Handling Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to see examples of corresponding documents.

# \<Title: Usually the Name of the Problem>

## Problem Description

Provide a detailed account of the circumstances under which this problem occurs, its impact scope, and its manifestations, along with the following supplementary information:

- Problem Screenshot: Text descriptions are currently preferred. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used. Users need to register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Relevant Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debug information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this problem (which could be a single confirmed cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause should meet the following criteria:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and confirmed to lead to this problem, rather than speculative or imagined reasons.
2. Provide a detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How this cause triggered the problem.
   - The specific mechanism and process of the problem occurring.

## Problem Diagnosis (Optional)

Detail the specific steps to diagnose the problem. Through the diagnosis process, users can identify the most likely or definite cause among multiple reasons and apply appropriate solutions. When performing problem diagnosis, attention should be given to:

- If there is only one root cause, provide diagnosis steps, ideally using an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Diagnosis Step 1
  ...
  n. Diagnosis Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different diagnosis steps, use third-level headings to list each root cause, and provide detailed diagnosis steps under each root cause.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Diagnosis Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnosis Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Diagnosis Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnosis Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple causes, if there is a single root cause, this title should be "Solution")

Detail the specific considerations, preconditions, and operational steps to resolve the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level title is "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes with different corresponding solutions, each solution should have its own second-level title named "Solution for Root Cause 1", "Solution for Root Cause N", etc.

### Considerations (Optional)

Important considerations to be aware of before beginning operations. Failure to read this section carefully may lead to operational failure or even more serious consequences.

### Preconditions (Optional)

Conditions that must be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level title can be omitted if there are no considerations or preconditions)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list format; if the steps are complicated, additional headings can be added between steps; in this case, fourth-level headings should outline each step, with specific procedures underneath listed in an ordered list.
- If operations are performed on a container platform, each operation's detailed steps can be listed comprehensively; if operations are performed on a third-party platform or other software, only key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if overly detailed steps are written, we cannot ensure timely updates to the documentation as interfaces change, potentially leading to various issues. Therefore, to ensure long-term usability of the document, descriptions of steps on third-party platforms should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Focus on core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid excessive reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain the generality and flexibility of operational step instructions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic process of operations.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be deleted)

The structure of this section should match that of the solution for Root Cause 1; no further elaboration is needed here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of this problem (suggestions, commands, operations, preconditions, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

Include content that is referenced in the document but is not suitable for inclusion in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
