title: Upgrade
---

:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade process, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade process between different versions, the upgrade document should be structured as a directory and different upgrade documents for each version should be provided within this directory (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.
