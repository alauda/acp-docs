1. What is Introduction 

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or functional modules, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It encompasses core concepts, key functionalities, target users, and intended use cases to give readers a clear initial understanding. 

We generally decide whether to combine the introduction, advantages, and functional overview sections into a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products containing multiple core modules), it is advisable to split these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be consolidated into one document. 

2. Importance of Introduction 

The product or functional module may involve many aspects, and adding an introduction at the beginning can: 

- Unified Understanding: It can provide a consistent recognition as an opening, reducing communication errors. 
- Guide Reading: Offer readers a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content. 
- Enhance Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repetitive explanations regarding basic product knowledge. 

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section 

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product in straightforward language, avoiding verbosity. 
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functionalities of the product. 
- Audience-Oriented: Consider the background of the target audience, providing information relevant to their concerns. 

4. Unique Aspects of Introduction 

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team convey the product's functional value more effectively, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize the product's features. 

There are some differences between product-level and module-level introductions: 

Characteristics of Product-Level Introduction 

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages. 
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and the functional system included in the product. 
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive and should be jointly explained based on the characteristics of different modules. 

Characteristics of Module-Level Introduction 

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product. 
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the individual module. 
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by the individual module.

# Introduction 

## \<Product/Module> Introduction 

> Other sections, if they are lengthy or relatively complex, can also be opened independently apart from this introduction. 

This is a short description. The specific introduction of the \<Product/Module Name> expected use case is as follows: for example: 

\<Container Management> is a container management module built on Kubernetes, designed for cloud-native applications. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure to achieve unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the application migration process for enterprises, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly set up an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
