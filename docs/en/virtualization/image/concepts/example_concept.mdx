Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.).
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document for multiple concept introductions; otherwise, it is recommended that each concept be introduced in a separate document.
For obscure and complex concepts, it is advisable to write a dedicated article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more comprehensive and accessible introduction.

You can access the [concept document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to see examples of corresponding documents.
