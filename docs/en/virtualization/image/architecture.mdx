:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Architectural Framework" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

It is recommended to link the "concepts" introduced in the framework to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require separate documentation, brief explanations can be provided in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for comprehensive introduction.

You can visit the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view a sample document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams regarding this functionality, which may include the following content:

- Core Components: Such as Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., depicting the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: Such as the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of how resources are consumed, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: Such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Include a description of the image below the architecture diagram, explaining its meaning and the roles of each part.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanations, please link to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts."
