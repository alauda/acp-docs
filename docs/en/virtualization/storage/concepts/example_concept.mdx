Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be consolidated into a single document for multiple concepts. Conversely, it is recommended to introduce each concept in a separate document. For obscure and complex concepts, consider writing a standalone article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a comprehensive introduction.

You can visit the [Concept Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to see examples of corresponding documents.
