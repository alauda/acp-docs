Introduce common problems that users may encounter along with their resolutions. If the content is minimal, it can be placed directly in a single page titled "Problem Handling." If the content is extensive, consider making "Problem Handling" a directory, with each problem addressed in a separate document.

You can visit the [Troubleshooting Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) for a sample of the corresponding document.

# \<Title: Typically the name of the problem>

## Problem Description

Provide a detailed explanation of the environment in which the problem occurs, its impact range, and the symptoms of the issue. Additionally, include the following supplementary information:

- Problem Screenshot: It is currently recommended to prioritize textual descriptions. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots may be used, and users need to register with the documentation team for discussions.
- Related Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this problem (these can either be a single definitive cause or multiple possible causes). For each cause, the following conditions must be met:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and been confirmed to lead to this problem, not speculative or hypothetical causes.
2. Provide a detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How the cause triggers the problem.
   - The specific mechanism and process through which the problem occurs.

## Problem Investigation (Optional)

List the specific steps for investigating the issue in detail. Through investigation, users can identify the most likely or certain cause from multiple potential causes and use appropriate solutions to address the problem. When conducting an investigation, be mindful of the following:

- If there is only one root cause, provide investigation steps, and it is recommended to display them in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Investigation Step 1
  ...
  n. Investigation Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different investigation steps, use third-level headings to list each root cause, providing detailed investigation steps under each cause.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Investigation Step 1
    ...
    n. Investigation Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Investigation Step 1
    ...
    n. Investigation Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is how the title is formatted when there are multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be "Solution")

Detail the specific considerations, prerequisites, and operational steps for resolving this issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level title should be "Solution." If there are multiple root causes, and each has a different solution, each solution should have its own second-level title, e.g., "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," etc.

### Considerations (Optional)

List any considerations that need to be taken into account before commencing operations. Failure to read this carefully may lead to operational failures or even more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

List the conditions that must be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level title can be omitted if there are no considerations or prerequisites)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list format. If the steps are complex, additional headings should be added to differentiate between multiple steps. Fourth-level headings can be used to list each step, with specific steps presented in ordered lists beneath each.
- If the operations are conducted in a container platform, detailed steps for each operation can be fully listed. If operations occur on third-party platforms or other software, only the critical steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For operations not conducted on a container platform, too many details may prevent us from ensuring timely updates to the documentation should the interface change, potentially causing many issues. Therefore, to maintain the long-term usability of the documentation, descriptions of steps on third-party platforms should adhere to the following principles:
  >
  > - Focus on core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid excessive reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic flow of the operations.

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is how the title is formatted when there are multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be removed)

The content in this section mirrors the format of the solution for Root Cause 1 and will not be repeated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of this issue (recommendations, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can store content used within the document that is not suitable for inclusion in the main text, such as tool usage, reference materials, etc.
