# Architecture

![](./assets/appservice_architecture_en.png)

The Alauda Application Services Platform is a comprehensive open service management solution built on Kubernetes (K8S), specifically designed for alauda application services operations. This platform acts as a centralized management hub, efficiently managing a wide variety of commonly used service components, including MySQL, Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ. Their interrelationships are as follows:

- Service Components: The Alauda Application Services Platform supports various service components, such as MySQL, Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ, all of which can run stably on the platform.

- Common Services: It provides parameter templates, inspection centers, alarm services, backup services, etc., offering users a one-stop service management solution.

- Operator Controller: The Operator Controller is an extension of Kubernetes, designed to simplify the deployment and management of applications. It extends the Kubernetes API through Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) to manage the lifecycle of applications.

- Container Infrastructure: The Alauda Application services Platform is built on Kubernetes and leverages the underlying infrastructure it provides to offer foundational capabilities such as data persistence and external access.
