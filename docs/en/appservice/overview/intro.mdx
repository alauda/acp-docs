# Introduction

## Application Service Overview

The application service platform is a service management module built on container and Kubernetes technologies, aimed at developers and operations personnel. It integrates rapid deployment, convenient management, and visual operation to help enterprises solve deployment and operations challenges, providing strong support for business application development.

## Advantages of Application Services

The core advantages of application services are as follows:

- Enterprise-level service availability and data security

  It provides industry-leading enterprise-level service availability and data security, designed to offer rock-solid support for the core operational activities of enterprises. By adopting advanced highly available architecture and data redundancy mechanisms, it can ensure business continuity under five major high-availability challenges: network disconnection, power failure, shutdown, restart, and high load. The product implements multi-level data security measures, including data redundancy, data backup, encrypted transmission, access control, real-time monitoring, and security auditing, to ensure the security of enterprise data during storage, processing, and transmission. This allows enterprises to confidently use this product to support their most valuable assetâ€”data.

- Cloud-native unified operations management

  A unified operations management platform that supports comprehensive functions like lifecycle management, observability, change management, backup recovery, auditing, and disaster recovery. High integration and automation capabilities provide enterprises with a simple, consistent interface to manage their application services.

- Out-of-the-box usability

  Simplifies the deployment and development process, enabling developers to freely use application services and providing an out-of-the-box operational interface for critical features, allowing users to quickly launch service instances at a low cost.

- Maximizing underlying resource utilization

  Implements a precise intelligent scheduling mechanism based on the Kubernetes (K8S) platform, maximizing resource utilization and ensuring that every computing resource is used effectively. Enterprises can dynamically adjust resource allocation based on real-time loads and can also plan resources according to business trends, thereby avoiding unnecessary resource wastage and performance bottlenecks, running their applications in a cloud computing environment with optimal cost efficiency, and maintaining business agility and responsiveness.

- Easily extensible

  Supports native plugins for various services, managing them alongside instances, and also supports adding custom plugins to further extend service capabilities.

## Application Scenarios of Application Services

The main application scenarios of application services are as follows:

- Unified IT Operations Management

  On the application service platform, the operations team can manage services across clusters for various projects through a centralized interface, ultimately achieving one-stop operations management. In the view, all application services within the enterprise can be viewed, and operations such as service deployment, monitoring, alerting, logging, backup, and recovery are supported, improving operational efficiency and reducing operational costs.

- Enterprise-level Application Deployment and Operations

  Enterprise-level application deployment and operations are one of the core application scenarios of the application service platform. Enterprises can deploy related application services in the production environment to achieve a stable, reliable, high-performance, and highly resource-utilizing service experience.

- Development and Testing Environment

  Supports developers and testers to independently bring up application services, allowing quick creation of low-overhead application service instances through forms, thereby improving development and testing efficiency.

## Usage Limitations of Application Services

When using application services in a production environment, the following limitations should be noted:

- Storage classes

  Use the recommended storage classes from the platform to ensure data security and reliability.

- Deployment dependencies

  Ensure that the target cluster has deployed the dependent components of the application services.
