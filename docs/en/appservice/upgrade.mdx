# Upgrade

If you are using Data Services views and related extensions, due to dependencies, please perform the upgrade in the following order:

First, upgrade Alauda Container Platform Data Services Essentials (type: cluster plugin) on the Global cluster.

Then, on the business cluster, first upgrade the Alauda Container Platform Data Services RDS Framework (type: Operator), followed by the following business extensions:

- <ExternalSiteLink name="mysql-mgr" href="/upgrade" children="Alauda Database Service for MySQL(MGR)"/>
- <ExternalSiteLink name="mysql-pxc" href="/upgrade" children="Alauda Database Service for MySQL(PXC)"/>
- <ExternalSiteLink name="redis" href="/upgrade" children="Alauda Cache Service for Redis OSS"/>
- <ExternalSiteLink name="kafka" href="/upgrade" children="Alauda Streaming Service for Kafka"/>
- <ExternalSiteLink name="rabbitmq" href="/upgrade" children="Alauda Streaming Service for RabbitMQ"/>
- <ExternalSiteLink name="postgresql" href="/upgrade" children="PostgreSQL (Provided by Alauda)"/>

Failure to upgrade in this order will result in the UI functionality of the views being unavailable.

:::warning
When upgrading the platform from v3.18 to v4.1, the above extensions must be upgraded simultaneously with the cluster.
:::

Alauda Container Platform Data Services Essentials are designed to upgrade automatically during platform upgrades, requiring no manual intervention. The system handles all necessary migrations and updates seamlessly in the background.

Alauda Container Platform Data Services RDS Framework will execute upgrades based on the configured upgrade strategy:
* **Automatic**: Auto-upgrades are triggered immediately upon detecting new component versions.
* **Manual**: Requires manual approval before initiating the upgrade process.

:::warning
When upgrading ACP from v3 to v4, it is recommended to promptly upgrade both the global cluster and workload clusters to the new version to ensure proper display of Data Services view.  
If only the global cluster is upgraded to v4 while workload clusters remain on v3, please contact the technical team during this period to obtain mitigation steps for view display issues in unupgraded workload clusters.
:::

:::note
**Known Issue (Fixed in ACP v4.1.1)**: In rare cases in versions prior to ACP v4.1.1, a bug in the update-manager could cause repeated crashes during the upgrade of the `rds-operator-updater` component, leading to automatic upgrade failures. If you encounter this issue during an upgrade to a version older than v4.1.1, manually uninstall the `rds-operator`. The system will then automatically reinstall the `rds-operator` and resume the upgrade process.
