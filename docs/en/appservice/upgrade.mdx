# Upgrade

Alauda Container Platform Data Services Essentials are designed to upgrade automatically during platform upgrades, requiring no manual intervention. The system handles all necessary migrations and updates seamlessly in the background.

Alauda Container Platform Data Services RDS Framework will execute upgrades based on the configured upgrade strategy:
* **Automatic**: Auto-upgrades are triggered immediately upon detecting new component versions.
* **Manual**: Requires manual approval before initiating the upgrade process.

:::warning
When upgrading ACP from v3 to v4, it is recommended to promptly upgrade both the global cluster and workload clusters to the new version to ensure proper display of Data Services view.  
If only the global cluster is upgraded to v4 while workload clusters remain on v3, please contact the technical team during this period to obtain mitigation steps for view display issues in unupgraded workload clusters.
:::

:::note
**Known Issue**: In rare cases, automatic upgrades might fail due to a bug that causes the update-manager to crash repeatedly during the upgrade of the `rds-updater` component. If this occurs, manually uninstall the `rds-operator`. The system will automatically reinstall the `rds-operator` and resume the upgrade process.
