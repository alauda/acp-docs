# Upgrade

Alauda Application Services Essentials are designed to upgrade automatically during platform upgrades, requiring no manual intervention. The system handles all necessary migrations and updates seamlessly in the background.

Alauda Application Services RDS Framework will execute upgrades based on the configured upgrade strategy:
* **Automatic**: Auto-upgrades are triggered immediately upon detecting new component versions.
* **Manual**: Requires manual approval before initiating the upgrade process.
