# Alauda Streaming Service for RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker and queue server that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). In simple terms, RabbitMQ acts as a communication bridge between applications, allowing different systems to asynchronously send and process messages. This provides a robust foundation for building decoupled, scalable, and resilient distributed systems.
