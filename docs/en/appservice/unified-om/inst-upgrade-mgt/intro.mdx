# Introduction

The Instance Upgrade Management Center primarily focuses on the upgrade management of Application Services instances, categorizing instances under specific Operators by component type and clearly displaying key information about the instances, such as instance name, status, version, and namespace. When the Operator completes an upgrade, if a new patch version is available, the system will automatically issue a notification on the instance list and details page, allowing users to be promptly informed of the upgrade opportunity. Additionally, users can flexibly choose one or more instances to perform batch upgrade operations within an appropriate time window based on their business needs and schedule, thus achieving efficient management of Application Services instance versions.

::: info

The current implementation of `Upgrade Management` primarily focuses on patch version upgrade management. If a user wishes to upgrade to a new major or minor version for a specific instance, they can update the instance and select the desired version directly. However, not all major or minor versions are supported for upgrades due to potential compatibility issues. Only supported versions are displayed in the web console.
