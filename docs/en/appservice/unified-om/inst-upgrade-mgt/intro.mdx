# Introduction

The Instance Upgrade Management Center primarily focuses on the upgrade management of Application Services instances, categorizing instances under specific Operators by component type and clearly displaying key information about the instances, such as instance name, status, version, and namespace. When the Operator completes an upgrade, if a new patch version is available, the system will automatically issue a notification on the instance list and details page, allowing users to be promptly informed of the upgrade opportunity. Additionally, users can flexibly choose one or more instances to perform batch upgrade operations within an appropriate time window based on their business needs and schedule, thus achieving efficient management of Application Services instance versions.

::: info

The current implementation of `Upgrade Management` primarily focuses on patch version upgrade management. If a user wishes to upgrade to a new major or minor version for a specific instance, they can update the instance and select the desired version directly. However, not all major or minor versions are supported for upgrades due to potential compatibility issues. Only supported versions are displayed in the web console.

## Product Advantages

- **Intelligent Upgrade Notifications**

After the Operator upgrade, the system automatically detects and alerts users to the new instance version, ensuring that users do not miss any upgrade opportunities. Timely upgrades can provide Application Services instances with better performance, more features, and enhanced security, offering robust support for stable business operations.

- **Batch Upgrade Operations**

Users can select one or more instances for batch upgrades within an appropriate time window, avoiding the tedious process of upgrading instances individually, saving substantial time and effort. Moreover, batch upgrades help unify the versions of Application Services instances, reducing compatibility issues arising from version inconsistencies.

- **Flexibility and Controllability**

Users can choose the time window for upgrading and the instances to be upgraded based on their actual business situation, ensuring that upgrade operations do not adversely impact the business. This flexible approach to upgrades grants users greater control, making the upgrade process more aligned with business needs.

## Use Cases

- **Version Update Maintenance**

When component developers release a new version that fixes known vulnerabilities, enhances performance, or adds new features, users can leverage the Instance Upgrade Management Center to promptly upgrade Application Services instances to the latest version for an improved user experience and greater security.

- **Reducing Business Impact from Upgrade Operations**

As the business evolves and changes, Application Services instances within the same cluster may have different maintenance time windows. Users can select one or more instances for batch upgrade operations within an appropriate time window based on their business needs and schedules, thereby avoiding unnecessary impacts on business operations.
