At the same time, it supports performing backup and recovery operations directly on selected instances, providing users with a one-stop operational experience without frequent switching between multiple interfaces, significantly improving the efficiency of data backup and recovery operations, which is especially suitable for complex scenarios involving large numbers of instances.

- **Comprehensive backup history management and file control**

This feature supports viewing backup history and managing backup files, allowing users to clearly understand the details of each backup, including backup time, backup status, etc. This helps users monitor and trace data backup situations comprehensively, enabling quick identification of the corresponding backup files for recovery in case of issues. In addition, effective management of backup files can avoid data recovery risks caused by disorganized or lost backup files, ensuring the safety and availability of data.

- **Efficient centralized management of external storage**

Supports centralized management of external object storage used for backups in the current project, covering registration, updating, and deleting access methods and keys for external storage. This centralized management model avoids the cumbersome process of users configuring different external storage separately, reducing management costs and error rates. Users can easily complete various operations on external storage in a unified interface, ensuring that backup data is stably and securely stored in appropriate external storage devices, further enhancing the reliability and maintainability of the entire backup system.

## Inspection Center

- **Multi-dimensional flexible management of inspection tasks**

The Inspection Center supports searching and managing inspection tasks in various ways, such as by cluster, namespace, instance type, trigger method, and keywords, covering operations like creation, updating, and deletion. This gives administrators great flexibility to accurately locate and manage inspection tasks based on actual needs, whether in simple or complex cluster environments. For example, in a large enterprise-level PaaS platform, there may be multiple different business clusters, numerous namespaces, and various instance types. This multi-dimensional management approach allows administrators to efficiently organize and adjust inspection work to meet diverse business scenario needs, enhancing the efficiency and precision of overall operation and maintenance management.

- **Automated inspections enhance efficiency and timeliness**

Supports the creation of automatically triggered inspections that can perform periodic automatic inspections of specified instances. This feature greatly reduces manual intervention, improving the efficiency and timeliness of inspection work. In PaaS platforms, where there are numerous instances and real-time operational requirements for business systems, manual inspections are not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also prone to omissions and delays. Automated inspections can comprehensively check specified instances at preset intervals, promptly identifying potential problems and anomalies, helping to take measures in advance to avoid expanded failures, ensuring the stable operation of the platform, and reducing operational costs.

- **Convenient display of inspection information provides a global perspective**

Supports quick display of the most recent 7-day inspection records, inspection results, and inspected instances, providing administrators with an overview of the inspection status. This allows administrators to quickly understand the overall situation of recent inspections without wading through a large volume of data. Through intuitive displays, administrators can promptly grasp the health status of each instance, issues discovered during inspections, and the execution status of inspection tasks, enabling them to make quick decisions and arrange subsequent operation and maintenance work more effectively.

## Alarm Strategy Management

- **Real-time insight and rapid response**

The real-time alarm feature can accurately display alarm information triggered in the past 1 hour to 7 days. This timely information presentation enables you to grasp the system's abnormal dynamics at the first moment and respond quickly. Moreover, it supports filtering the displayed results based on cluster, namespace, instance type, and alarm policy, allowing users to focus on key information according to their needs, avoiding being overwhelmed by vast amounts of alarm data. For instance, in a complex multi-cluster environment of a large enterprise, operations and maintenance personnel can quickly pinpoint key instance alarms under a specific cluster, significantly shortening the fault handling time and ensuring business continuity.

- **Flexible customization for precise monitoring**

Alarm strategy management provides rich customization options. Users can create alarm strategies for specified namespaces, targeting specific component types or even specific instances. Not only does it support single metric alarms, but it also allows for combined operations on single metrics to achieve precise monitoring in complex scenarios. For example, when monitoring database performance, you can customize a comprehensive alarm strategy by combining multiple metrics such as CPU usage rate, memory occupancy rate, and disk I/O to better assess the health of the database. Additionally, users can flexibly specify notification strategies for alarm moments to ensure that relevant personnel receive important alarm information in a timely manner.

- **Historical tracing for optimized decision-making**

The historical alarm feature allows you to view alarm information that has stopped in the past 1 hour to 7 days and also supports multi-dimensional filtering. By analyzing historical alarm data, you can gain deeper insights into the system's fault patterns and trends, identifying potential root causes of issues. This aids in optimizing system configurations and alarm strategies, reducing the occurrence of similar faults in the future. For example, by reviewing historical alarms in a certain namespace over a period, you may discover that a particular component frequently experiences performance bottlenecks, prompting preemptive resource adjustments or upgrades.

- **Comprehensive coverage for efficient management**

The functionalities of real-time alarms, alarm strategy management, and historical alarms work together to form a comprehensive alarm management system. Whether focusing on current real-time anomalies, needing to review and summarize historical alarms, or flexibly configuring alarm strategies, all can be easily accomplished on our platform. This one-stop solution greatly increases the efficiency of operation and maintenance management and reduces management costs, allowing users to focus more on business development.
