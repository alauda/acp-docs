# Introduction

The Inspection Center is a crucial module in the application service product, primarily focusing on conducting comprehensive and meticulous inspection operations on the middleware supported by the platform. The Inspection Center offers diverse triggering methods, allowing manual triggering of inspections to meet the user's need for proactive checks at specific time points, as well as supporting automatic triggering of inspections based on preset rules for immediate or periodic inspections, ensuring continuous and regular monitoring of the middleware's operational status. Additionally, the Inspection Center boasts powerful result presentation and analysis capabilities, generating inspection reports and providing recent overviews of inspections for users to quickly grasp the overall situation, while also delivering professional diagnoses and highly valuable optimization suggestions for any anomalies discovered during the inspection process. To facilitate further data utilization and sharing, the Inspection Center thoughtfully supports the export of inspection reports.
