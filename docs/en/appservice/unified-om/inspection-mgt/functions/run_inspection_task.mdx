# Inspection Task Execution

## Function Overview

There are two trigger methods for inspection tasks: manual trigger and scheduled trigger. If a user chooses to manually trigger an inspection, the corresponding inspection action will be executed immediately, and the inspection results will be presented in different locations depending on the trigger method.

- If the user triggers the inspection from the details page of a specific component instance, the inspection results will be displayed on that component instance's details page, and will also appear on the inspection report page, as shown in the images below:

- If the user triggers it on a specific inspection task, whether manually or automatically, the inspection results will be presented in the form of inspection records on that task's inspection records, as illustrated below:

## Main Functions

The result of a specific execution of an inspection task can be queried through the CLI, as shown below:
