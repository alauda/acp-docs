# Update and Delete Inspection Tasks

Users can adjust the configuration of inspection tasks to meet business needs by updating or deleting the inspection tasks during use.

## Procedure

### Update Inspection Tasks

<Tabs>

<Tab lable="CLI">

Updating an inspection task is similar to updating other K8S resources. The configuration of the inspection task can be updated using the `kubectl edit` command.

```shell
$ kubectl edit iotedgeinspection <inspection_name>

===
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.

It is important to note that users can only update fields within the `spec` structure; fields in the `status` and `metadata` structures are read-only.

### Delete Inspection Tasks

Deleting an inspection task is similar to deleting other K8S resources. The inspection task can be deleted using the `kubectl delete` command.

```shell
kubectl delete -n <namespace> inspection <inspection_name>
```

::: info

It is important to note that, by design, `inspectionjob` corresponds one-to-one with `inspection`. Therefore, when an `inspection` is deleted, the corresponding `inspectionjob` will be automatically deleted.
