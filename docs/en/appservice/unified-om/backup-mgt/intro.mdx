# Introduction

The Backup Center, as a crucial module within the application service platform, serves as the management hub for cross-instance data backup and recovery operations. It provides users with a comprehensive and convenient solution to manage the backup and recovery process of data. Users can utilize the Backup Center to filter instances based on component type, namespace, or keywords, allowing them to quickly and accurately display the required backup records. At the same time, users can easily perform backup and recovery operations on selected instances, as well as conveniently view backup history and manage backup files. The Backup Management Center also supports centralized management of external object storage used for backups, covering operations such as registering, updating, and deleting access methods and keys for external storage.
