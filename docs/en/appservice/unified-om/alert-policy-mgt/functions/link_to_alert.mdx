# Relationship with Platform Capabilities

Alert is one of the core capabilities of the platform, which offers a wide range of alerting functionalities for six resource categories including Application Service. The alert center of the Application Service is a subset of the platform's alerting capabilities. For detailed information on creating alert strategies and setting up silent alerts, please refer to [Alert Management](/observability/monitor/functions/manage_alert.mdx).

::: info

Due to permission considerations, the Alert Management under the Application Service view and the Alert Management under the Platform Management view are isolated from each other at the data level. This means that if a user creates an alert policy in the Application Service view, the management of that policy (such as updating, viewing, and deleting) must still be performed within the Application Service view, and vice versa.
