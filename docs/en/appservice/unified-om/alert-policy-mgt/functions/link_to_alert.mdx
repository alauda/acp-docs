# Relationship with Platform Capabilities

Alert strategies are one of the core capabilities of the platform, which offers a wide range of alerting functionalities, including six different resource types, among which is the application service type. The alert center under the application service product view represents a subset of the platform's alerting capabilities. For information on creating alert strategies and setting up silent alerts, please refer to [Managing Alerts](/observability/monitor/functions/manage_alert.mdx).
