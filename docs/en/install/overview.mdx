# Installation Overview

This document is intended for system administrators with a basic knowledge of Linux, providing a detailed step-by-step guide for installing the <ProductShortBrand /> management cluster.

In this document, the following terms will be frequently used, please make sure to distinguish between them:

- **Management Cluster** (or **`global` cluster**): Refers to the cluster responsible for the core management tasks of the platform, such as cluster management, tenant management, etc. Installing the management cluster completes the installation of the platform. Once the installation is complete, you can connect or create business clusters as needed.

- **Platform** (or **<ProductShortBrand />**): Typically refers to the container platform itself, which provides an application runtime environment and integrates container scheduling, management, networking, storage, and other functions into a complete system. **Platform** is an overall concept that encompasses all components, including the management cluster and business clusters.

<Directive type="tip" title="Important Reminder">
Before installation, please ensure that capacity planning, environmental preprocessing, and prerequisite checks are completed, ensuring that the hardware, network, and operating systems of all nodes meet the required specifications.
The following content covers platform architecture design, installation methods, and key terminology explanations to help you grasp the key points during the actual installation process.

## Platform Architecture

- **Architecture Design**
  - **Management Cluster**: Responsible for the core management of the platform, providing cluster and tenant management, as well as global scheduling. After installing the management cluster, you can connect or create business clusters as needed.
  - **Business Cluster**: Dedicated to hosting business workloads, supporting horizontal scaling.

- **Design Principles**
  1. **Control Plane Isolation**
     The management cluster must be installed on dedicated physical resources, separate from the business clusters, to ensure the stability and security of the control plane.
  2. **Hybrid Deployment Compatibility**
     In development, testing, or resource-constrained environments, it is permissible to run business workloads within the management cluster (i.e., `global` cluster) to combine management and business functionality.
  3. **Standardized Access Specifications**
     Two methods of accessing business clusters are supported:
     - Create new business clusters (recommended)
     - Access existing clusters that meet version requirements (pre-check required)

## Installation Process

The installation process for the management cluster is divided into three stages:

1. Preparation Phase
   - **Prerequisite Check**: Ensure that all nodes' hardware, network, and operating systems meet the required specifications, such as kernel version, CPU architecture, network configuration, etc.
   - **Download and Verify Installation Package**: Log in to the Customer Portal to obtain the latest installation package and signature files, then use the GPG tool to verify the integrity and correctness of the package.
   - **Node Preprocessing**: Complete the preprocessing of all nodes.

2. Execution Phase
   - **Upload and Extract Installation Package**: Upload the installation package to the target control node (recommended directory: `/root/cpaas-install`), and extract the installation resources.
   - **Start the Installer**: Execute the installation script (e.g., `bash setup.sh`) on the control node. Depending on the environment, select the network plugin (Kube-OVN or Calico), IP protocol mode (IPv4/IPv6/dual-stack), and VIP configuration.
   - **Parameter Configuration**: Access the Web UI provided by the installer, and configure Kubernetes version, cluster network, node names, access addresses, and other key parameters to complete the installation of the management cluster.

3. Validation Phase
   - **System Status Check**: After installation, log in to the platform's Web UI to check the status of the management cluster and the running state of its components.
   - **CLI Verification**: Use the command-line tool to check the resource status of the cluster, ensuring that all services are running normally with no issues or failures.

## Terminology Explanation

- **VIP (Virtual IP)**
  A Virtual IP address used to load balance access to the management cluster's API Server, Web UI, and other entry points, ensuring high availability.

Subsequent chapters will provide detailed instructions on operations, configuration parameters, and validation methods for each installation phase. Please carefully read and complete the necessary preparations before proceeding with the installation.
