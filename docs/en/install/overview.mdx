# Overview

By following this guide, you will complete the installation of **<Term name="productShort" /> Core**.
If you need to understand the concept of **<Term name="productShort" /> Core**, refer to [Architecture](../overview/architecture.mdx).

Installing **<Term name="productShort" /> Core** refers to the process of deploying the `global` cluster.

After the installation, you can **create new workload clusters** or **connect existing ones**, and install additional **Extensions** to enhance the platform's capabilities.

<Directive type="info" title="INFO">
Before installation, please ensure that you have completed capacity planning, environment preprocessing, and prerequisite checks to ensure that the hardware, network, and OS of each node meet the requirements.
The following content covers platform architecture design, installation methods, and key term explanations to help you grasp the core points during the actual installation process.
</Directive>

## Installation Method

The installation process of the `global` cluster is mainly divided into three stages:

1.  **Preparation Stage**
    -   **Prerequisite Check**: Ensure that all node hardware, network, and OS meet the requirements, such as kernel version, CPU architecture, and network configuration.
    -   **Installation Package Download**: Log in to the <Term name="company" /> Customer Portal to obtain the latest installation package.
    -   **Node Preprocessing**: Complete the preprocessing work of all nodes.

2.  **Execution Stage**
    -   **Installation Package Upload and Extraction**: Upload the installation package to the target control plane node (recommended directory: `/root/cpaas-install`) and extract the installation resources.
    -   **Start the Installer**: Execute the installation script (such as `bash setup.sh`) on the control plane node, and select the network plugin (Kube-OVN or Calico), IP protocol mode (IPv4/IPv6/dual stack), and VIP configuration according to the actual environment.
    -   **Parameter Configuration**: Access the Web UI provided by the installer, and set the Kubernetes version, cluster network, node name, access address, and other key parameters in sequence to complete the installation of the `global` cluster.

3.  **Verification Stage**
    -   **System Status Check**: After the installation is complete, log in to the platform Web UI to check the cluster status and the operating status of each component.
    -   **CLI Verification**: Use command-line tools to check the cluster resource status to ensure that all services are running normally and there are no exceptions or failures.

The following chapters will further explain the detailed operations, configuration parameters, and verification methods of each installation stage. Please read carefully and complete the corresponding preparatory work before the formal installation.

## Appendix — <Term name="company" /> Customer Portal
