# Overview

This document is intended for system administrators with basic Linux knowledge and details the full installation process of the <Term name="productShort" /> `global` cluster.

In this document, the following terms will be used frequently, please pay attention to the distinction:

-   **`global` cluster**: Refers to the cluster responsible for core platform management tasks, such as cluster management and tenant management. Completing the installation of the `global` cluster completes the <Term name="productShort" /> installation. After installation, workload clusters can be accessed or created as needed.

-   **Platform**: Usually refers to the container platform itself, a complete system that provides an application runtime environment and integrates container scheduling, management, networking, storage, and other functions. The **platform** is an overall concept that covers all components, including the `global` cluster and workload clusters.

<Directive type="info" title="INFO">
Before installation, please ensure that you have completed capacity planning, environment preprocessing, and prerequisite checks to ensure that the hardware, network, and OS of each node meet the requirements.
The following content covers platform architecture design, installation methods, and key term explanations to help you grasp the core points during the actual installation process.
</Directive>

## Installation Method

The installation process of the `global` cluster is mainly divided into three stages:

1.  **Preparation Stage**
    -   **Prerequisite Check**: Ensure that all node hardware, network, and OS meet the requirements, such as kernel version, CPU architecture, and network configuration.
    -   **Installation Package Download and Verification**: Log in to the Customer Portal to obtain the latest installation package and signature file, and use the GPG tool to verify the integrity and correctness of the package.
    -   **Node Preprocessing**: Complete the preprocessing work of all nodes.

2.  **Execution Stage**
    -   **Installation Package Upload and Extraction**: Upload the installation package to the target control plane node (recommended directory: `/root/cpaas-install`) and extract the installation resources.
    -   **Start the Installer**: Execute the installation script (such as `bash setup.sh`) on the control plane node, and select the network plugin (Kube-OVN or Calico), IP protocol mode (IPv4/IPv6/dual stack), and VIP configuration according to the actual environment.
    -   **Parameter Configuration**: Access the Web UI provided by the installer, and set the Kubernetes version, cluster network, node name, access address, and other key parameters in sequence to complete the installation of the `global` cluster.

3.  **Verification Stage**
    -   **System Status Check**: After the installation is complete, log in to the platform Web UI to check the cluster status and the operating status of each component.
    -   **CLI Verification**: Use command-line tools to check the cluster resource status to ensure that all services are running normally and there are no exceptions or failures.

## Terminology Explanation

-   **VIP (Virtual IP)**
    Virtual IP address, used for load balancing the `global` cluster's API Server, Web UI, and other access points to ensure high availability.

The following chapters will further explain the detailed operations, configuration parameters, and verification methods of each installation stage. Please read carefully and complete the corresponding preparatory work before the formal installation.
