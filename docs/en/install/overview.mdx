# Installation Overview

This document is intended for system administrators with basic Linux knowledge and details the full installation process of the <ProductShortBrand /> global cluster.

In this document, the following terms will be used frequently, please pay attention to the distinction:

-   **global cluster**: Refers to the cluster responsible for core platform management tasks, such as cluster management and tenant management. Completing the installation of the global cluster completes the <ProductShortBrand /> installation. After installation, workload clusters can be accessed or created as needed.

-   **Platform**: Usually refers to the container platform itself, a complete system that provides an application runtime environment and integrates container scheduling, management, networking, storage, and other functions. The **platform** is an overall concept that covers all components, including the global cluster and workload clusters.

<Directive type="tip" title="Important Notice">
Before installation, please ensure that you have completed capacity planning, environment preprocessing, and prerequisite checks to ensure that the hardware, network, and OS of each node meet the requirements.
The following content covers platform architecture design, installation methods, and key term explanations to help you grasp the core points during the actual installation process.
</Directive>

## Platform Architecture

-   **Architecture Design**
    -   **global cluster**: Responsible for core platform management, providing cluster, tenant management, and global scheduling.
    -   **Workload cluster**: Dedicated to carrying application workloads and supports horizontal scaling.

-   **Design Principles**
    1.  **Control Plane Isolation**
        When installing the global cluster, dedicated physical resources must be used and not shared with workload clusters to ensure the stability and security of the control plane.
    2.  **Hybrid Deployment Compatibility**
        In development and testing environments or in resource-constrained situations, it is allowed to run application workloads on the global cluster at the same time to achieve co-location of management and applications.
    3.  **Standardized Access Specifications**
        Supports two workload cluster access methods:
        -   Create a new workload cluster (recommended)
        -   Access existing clusters that meet the version requirements (pre-check required)

    ```

## Installation Method

The installation process of the global cluster is mainly divided into three stages:

1.  **Preparation Stage**
    -   **Prerequisite Check**: Ensure that all node hardware, network, and OS meet the requirements, such as kernel version, CPU architecture, and network configuration.
    -   **Installation Package Download and Verification**: Log in to the Customer Portal to obtain the latest installation package and signature file, and use the GPG tool to verify the integrity and correctness of the package.
    -   **Node Preprocessing**: Complete the preprocessing work of all nodes.

2.  **Execution Stage**
    -   **Installation Package Upload and Extraction**: Upload the installation package to the target control plane node (recommended directory: `/root/cpaas-install`) and extract the installation resources.
    -   **Start the Installer**: Execute the installation script (such as `bash setup.sh`) on the control plane node, and select the network plugin (Kube-OVN or Calico), IP protocol mode (IPv4/IPv6/dual stack), and VIP configuration according to the actual environment.
    -   **Parameter Configuration**: Access the Web UI provided by the installer, and set the Kubernetes version, cluster network, node name, access address, and other key parameters in sequence to complete the installation of the global cluster.

3.  **Verification Stage**
    -   **System Status Check**: After the installation is complete, log in to the platform Web UI to check the cluster status and the operating status of each component.
    -   **CLI Verification**: Use command-line tools to check the cluster resource status to ensure that all services are running normally and there are no exceptions or failures.

## Terminology Explanation

-   **VIP (Virtual IP)**
    Virtual IP address, used for load balancing the global cluster's API Server, Web UI, and other access points to ensure high availability.

The following chapters will further explain the detailed operations, configuration parameters, and verification methods of each installation stage. Please read carefully and complete the corresponding preparatory work before the formal installation.
