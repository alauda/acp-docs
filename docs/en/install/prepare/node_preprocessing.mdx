# Node Preprocessing

Before installing the `global` cluster, all nodes (control plane nodes and worker nodes) must complete preprocessing.

## Supported OS and Kernel Versions \{#supported_os_and_kernels}

The following table lists the supported operating systems, their validated versions, and the corresponding tested kernel versions.

:::info
Only the kernel version shipped with the official operating system is supported.
The kernel version must match the tested version (for example, A.B.C); the suffix after the dash (“-”) may differ.

If the OS, kernel version, or CPU architecture does not meet the requirements, please contact technical support.

## Execute the Quick Configuration Script

The <Term name="productShort" /> installation package provides a script for quickly configuring nodes.

Unzip the installation package to obtain the `init.sh` script file in the `res` directory. Copy the script file to the nodes and ensure that you have `root` privileges.

Execute the script:

```bash
bash init.sh
```

<Directive type="warning" title="WARNING">
`init.sh` cannot guarantee that all of the following checks are properly handled. You still need to continue with the steps below.
</Directive>

## Node Checks \{#node_checks}

The following lists all the checks that must be completed on the nodes. Depending on the node's role, the required checks will vary. For example, some checks apply only to control plane nodes.

Checks are divided into two categories:

- ✅ Indicates a check that must pass.
- ⚠️ Indicates a check that must be met in specific scenarios. Please determine whether the corresponding conditions are met according to the instructions. If they are, you must resolve them.

The following is the list of checks:

- **OS and Kernel**
  - ✅ The machine's grub boot configuration must have the `transparent_hugepage=never` parameter.
  - ✅ CentOS 7.x system machine's grub boot configuration must have the `cgroup.memory=nokmem` parameter.
  - ✅ Check whether the kernel modules `ip_vs`, `ip_vs_rr`, `ip_vs_wrr`, and `ip_vs_sh` are enabled.
  - ⚠️ When the kernel version is lower than 4.19.0 (or RHEL is lower than 4.18.0), check whether the kernel modules `nf_conntrack_ipv4` and (for IPv6) `nf_conntrack_ipv6` are enabled.
  - ⚠️ If the `global` cluster plans to use `Kube-OVN` CNI, the kernel modules `geneve` and `openvswitch` must be enabled.
  - ✅ Disable apparmor/selinux and firewall.
  - ✅ Disable `swap` .

- **Users and Permissions**
  - ✅ The node's SSH user has `root` privileges and can use `sudo` without the password.
  - ✅ The `UseDNS` and `UsePAM` parameters in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` must be set to `no`.
  - ✅ Executing `systemctl show --property=DefaultTasksMax` returns `infinity` or a very large value; otherwise, adjust `/etc/systemd/system.conf`.

- **Node Network**
  - ✅ `hostname` must comply with the following rules:
    - No more than 36 characters.
    - Starts and ends with a letter or number.
    - Contains only lowercase letters, numbers, `-`, and `.`, but cannot contain `.-`, `..`, or `-.`.
  - ✅ `localhost` in `/etc/hosts` must resolve to `127.0.0.1`.
  - ✅ The `/etc/resolv.conf` file must exist and contain `nameserver` configurations, but must not contain addresses starting with 172 (disable systemd-resolved).
  - ⚠️ The `/etc/resolv.conf` file should not configure search domains (if you must configure them, see [Configure Search Domain](#config_search)).
  - ✅ The machine's IP address cannot be a loopback, multicast, link-local, all-0, or broadcast address.
  - ✅ Executing `ip route` must return a default route or a route pointing to `0.0.0.0`.
  - ✅ The nodes must not occupy the following ports:
    - **Control plane nodes:** `2379`, `2380`, `6443`, `10249` ~ `10256`
    - **Node where the installer is located:** `8080`, `12080`, `12443`, `16443`, `2379`, `2380`, `6443`, `10249` ~ `10256`
    - **Worker nodes:** `10249` ~ `10256`
  - ✅ If the cluster uses **Kube-OVN** or **Calico**, ensure that the following ports are not occupied:
    - **Kube-OVN:** `6641`, `6642`
    - **Calico:** `179`
  - ⚠️ Ensure that the IP addresses in the network segment `172.16.x.x` ~ `172.32.x.x` required by Docker are not occupied. If the IPs in this network segment are occupied and cannot be changed, please contact technical support.

- **Software and Directory Requirements:**
  - ✅ Must have the following installed: `ip`, `ss`, `tar`, `swapoff`, `modprobe`, `sysctl`, `md5sum`, and `scp` or `sftp`.
  - ⚠️ If you plan to use local storage **TopoLVM** or **Rook**, you need to install `lvm2`.
  - ✅ The `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service` file is not allowed to exist.
  - ✅ `/tmp` mount parameters must not contain `noexec`.
  - ✅ Remove packages that conflict with `global` cluster components (see [Remove Conflicting Packages](#remove_conflicting_packages)).
  - ✅ The following files must be deleted if they exist:
    - `/var/lib/docker`
    - `/var/lib/containerd`
    - `/var/log/pods`
    - `/var/lib/kubelet/pki`

- **Cross-Node Checks**
  - ✅ There must be no network firewall restrictions between nodes in the `global` cluster.
  - ✅ The `hostname` of each node in the cluster must be unique.
  - ✅ The time zones of all nodes must be unified, and the time synchronization error must be ≤ 10 seconds.

## Appendix

### Remove Conflicting Packages \{#remove_conflicting_packages}

Before installation, applications may already be running in the docker/containerd environment on the nodes, or software conflicting with the `global` cluster may have been installed. Therefore, it is necessary to check and uninstall conflicting packages.

<Directive type="danger" title="DANGER">
- To avoid application interruption or data loss, be sure to confirm whether there are conflicting software packages. When a conflict is found, please develop an application switching plan and back up your data before uninstalling.
- After uninstalling conflicting packages, you still need to check whether there are other potentially conflicting binary files in directories such as `/usr/local/bin/` (such as software related to docker, containerd, runc, podman, container network, container runtime, or Kubernetes).

### Configure Search Domain \{#config_search}

In Linux OS, the `/etc/resolv.conf` file is used to configure DNS client domain name resolution settings. The `search` line specifies the domain search path for DNS queries.

**Configuration Requirements**

- **Number of Domains:** The number of domains in the `search` line should be less than `domainCountLimit - 3` (default `domainCountLimit` is 32).
- **Length of Single Domain:** Each domain name must not exceed 253 characters.
- **Total Character Length:** The total character count of all domain names and spaces must not exceed `MaxDNSSearchListChar` (default is 2048).

**Example**

```text
search domain1.com domain2.com domain3.com
```

- The total number of domains is 3.
- The length of a single domain, such as `domain1.com`, is 11.
- The total character length is 35, i.e., 11 + 11 + 11 + 2 (two spaces).

<Directive type="warning" title="WARNING">
- If the `search` line in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file does not meet the above limitations, it may cause DNS query failures or performance degradation.
- Before modifying the `/etc/resolv.conf` file, it is recommended to back up the file.
</Directive>
