# Download Installation Package \{#download_installation_package}

Before installation, you need to download and extract the installation packages. If you require the Extensions Package, please extract the Core Package first, followed by the Extensions Package, into the same directory before starting the installation.

<Steps>

## Download the Installation Packages

Log in to the **Customer Portal** to download the installation packages. If you have not registered an account, please contact technical support.

Two types of installation packages are available:
- **Core Package**: Required for all installations
- **Extensions Package**: Optional, download only if needed for additional functionality

## Core Package Documentation

Download the core package installer-core-v4.x.y-zzzz.tar. Here, "zzzz" may be x86, arm, or hybrid, depending on the architecture chosen by the user (the same applies below).
Extract the core package using the tar command:
```shell
tar xvf installer-core-v4.x.y-zzzz.tar
```

## Extensions Package Documentation

Download the extensions package installer-extensions-v4.x.y-zzzz.tar. Here, "zzzz" must match the core package. The extensions package contains plugins that are not included in the core package.
If you downloaded the Extensions Package, you need to extract the extensions package to the same directory before installation:
```bash
tar xvf installer-extensions-v4.x.y-zzzz.tar -C <the core package extraction directory>
```

Example:
If the core package was extracted to /root, there would be an installer directory under /root after extraction.
You should execute the following command in the directory where installer-extensions-v4.x.y-zzzz.tar is located: `tar xvf installer-extensions-v4.x.y-zzzz.tar -C /root/`

</Steps>

The installation guide will detail the Core Package installation process. The Extensions Package documentation will provide specific instructions for using and configuring the extensions.
