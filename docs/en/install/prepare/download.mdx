# Download Core Package \{#download_core_package}

Before installation, you need to download the **Core Package**.

<Directive type="info" title="INFO">
Starting from <Term name="product" /> v4.1, if you download both the **Core Package** and the **Extensions Packages**, you must complete the installation of the **Core Package** before uploading and installing **Extensions Packages**.
</Directive>

Log in to the **<Term name="company" /> Customer Portal** to download the **Core Package**.

Packages are available for **x86**, **ARM**, and **hybrid** architectures. The hybrid package includes images for both x86 and ARM, resulting in a larger package size. Select the package that best matches your environment.

If you do not have a registered account, please contact technical support.

## Migrating from Single-Architecture to Hybrid

If you initially installed with an x86 or ARM Core Package but later need to support another architecture, you must re-download the **hybrid Core Package** and perform the following steps:

1. Upload the newly downloaded hybrid Core Package to any control plane node of the global cluster.

2. Extract the package and use the included `upgrade.sh` script to synchronize the multi-architecture images to your image registry:

   ```shell
   bash upgrade.sh --only-sync-image=true
   ```

3. After the script completes, check the `cluster.platform.tkestack.io` resource to verify whether the label `cpaas.io/node-arch-constraint` exists. If it does, you must remove it:

   ```shell
   kubectl get cluster.platform.tkestack.io global -oyaml | grep cpaas.io/node-arch-constraint
   # If there is output, edit the resource to remove the label; otherwise, you can skip this step.
   kubectl edit cluster.platform.tkestack.io global   ### Edit the labels field and delete cpaas.io/node-arch-constraint
   ```
