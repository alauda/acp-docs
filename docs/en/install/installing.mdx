# Installing

This section describes the specific steps for installing the `global` cluster.

Before starting the installation, please ensure that you have completed the prerequisite checks, installation package download and verification, node preprocessing, and other preparatory work.

## Process

<Steps>
### Upload and Extract Installation Package

Upload the Core Package installation package to any machine of the `global` cluster control plane nodes, and extract it according to the following command:

```shell
# Assume that the /root/cpaas-install folder already exists on the machine
tar -xvf {Path to Core Package File}/{Core Package File Name} -C /root/cpaas-install
cd /root/cpaas-install/installer || exit 1
```

<Directive type="info" title="INFO">
- This machine will become the first control plane node after the `global` cluster installation is complete.
- After the Core Package is extracted, at least **100GB** of disk space is required. Please ensure sufficient storage resources.
- If you have downloaded the Extensions Package, please extract it and refer to the documentation included within the package before proceeding to the next steps.
</Directive>

### Start the Installer

Execute the following installation script to start the installer. After the installer starts successfully, the command line terminal will output the web console access address.

After waiting for about 5 minutes, you can use a browser on your PC to access the web console provided by the installer.

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

<Directive type="warning" title="WARNING">
Ensure that the IP address and port 8080 of the node where the installer is located can be accessed normally, so that the web console provided by the installer can be accessed smoothly after the installer starts successfully.
</Directive>

#### Network Mode and IP Family

```bash
bash setup.sh --network-mode calico
```

The `--network-mode` parameter affects the CNI of the `global` cluster created by the installer. If this parameter is not specified, the CNI of the `global` cluster will default to Kube-OVN. If you want Calico as the CNI, you must explicitly specify `--network-mode calico`.

```bash
bash setup.sh --ip-family ipv6
```

If you plan to create a `global` cluster with Single-stack Network IPv6, you must explicitly specify `--ip-family ipv6` when starting the installer. Without this parameter, the `global` cluster created by the installer will support Single-stack Network IPv4 and Dual-stack Network by default.

### Parameter Configuration

After completing the installation parameter configuration according to the page guide, confirm the installation.

[Parameter Description](#parameters) provides detailed descriptions of key parameters. Please read carefully and configure according to actual needs.

### Verify Successful Installation

After the installation is complete, the platform access address will be displayed on the page. Click the **Access** button to jump to the platform Web UI.

In the **Platform Management** view, click **Cluster Management > Clusters** in sequence, and find the cluster named `global`.

Select `CLI Tools` from the drop-down menu on the right, and execute the following command to verify the installation status:

```shell
# Check if there are failed Charts
kubectl get apprelease --all-namespaces
# Check if there are failed Pods
kubectl get pod --all-namespaces | awk '{if ($4 != "Running" && $4 != "Completed")print}' | awk -F'[/ ]+' '{if ($3 != $4)print}'
```
</Steps>

        Enter the pre-prepared domain name. If no domain name is available, enter the pre-prepared <code>`global` VIP</code>.<br />
        <code>Self-Built VIP</code> is disabled by default, only enable it if you have not provided a LoadBalancer. After enabling, the installer will automatically deploy <code>keepalived</code> to provide software load balancing support.<br />
        <b>Note:</b> The following conditions must be met when using <code>Self-Built VIP</code>,<br />
        - A usable VRID is available;<br />
        - The host network supports the VRRP protocol;<br />
        - All control plane nodes and the VIP must be on the same subnet.<br />
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <b>Tip:</b> For single-node deployments in feature experience scenarios, you can directly enter the node IP. There is no need to enable <code>Self-Built VIP</code> or prepare network resources such as <code>`global` VIP</code>.

  <tr>
    <td><b>Platform Access Address</b></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        If you do not need to distinguish between <b>Cluster Address</b> and <b>Platform Access Address</b>, enter the same address as the <b>Cluster Address</b>.<br />
        If you need to distinguish, for example, if the `global` cluster is only for internal network access and the platform needs to provide external network access, enter the pre-prepared domain name or <code>External IP</code>.<br />
        The platform uses HTTPS access by default and does not enable HTTP. If you need to enable HTTP access, enable it in <b>Advanced Settings</b> (not recommended).<br />
        <b>Note:</b> A domain name must be entered in the following cases,<br />
        - A disaster recovery plan for the `global` cluster is planned;<br />
        - The platform needs to support IPv6 access.<br />
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <b>Tip:</b> If you need to configure more platform access addresses, you can add them in <b>Other Settings > Other Platform Access Addresses</b> in the next step. Or, after installation, add them in platform management according to the user manual.<br />

      <p>When using Kube-OVN, you can specify the node network card by entering the gateway name.</p>
      <p>If the node availability check fails, please adjust it according to the page prompt and add it again.</p>

## Installer Cleanup

Normally, the installer will be automatically deleted after installation. If the installer is not automatically deleted after 30 minutes of installation, please execute the following command on the node where the installer is located to force delete the installer container:

```bash
docker rm -f minialauda-control-plane
```
