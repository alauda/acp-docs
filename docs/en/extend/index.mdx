# Extend

The platform provides a comprehensive extension system that allows users to enhance the functionality of their Kubernetes clusters. This system is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, enabling users to easily add new features and capabilities to their clusters.

This system consists of two main extension types:

- Operators: Operators are built on the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v0 framework, providing specialized operational capabilities for the platform. These extensions enable automated management of complex applications and services within your cluster.

- Cluster Plugins: The platform features a proprietary cluster plugin system specifically designed for Chart-type plugins. This system delivers an improved installation and management experience compared to standard methods, with a user-friendly interface for handling Chart-based extensions.

With support for numerous Operators and cluster plugins, users can significantly expand the platform's capabilities to meet specific operational requirements and use cases.
