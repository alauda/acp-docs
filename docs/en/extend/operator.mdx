# Operator

## Overview

Operators are used to package, deploy, and manage Kubernetes applications, managing the entire lifecycle of Kubernetes resources.

## Introduction

Operators automate the full lifecycle of Kubernetes applications, including creation, updates, and deletion. Platform administrators can deploy Operators from the OperatorHub on a per-cluster basis.

## Key Concepts

* **OperatorHub**: A web console displaying available Operators, allowing administrators to view details and perform installation and management.
* **Resources**: CRDs managed by Operators, storing specific types of API objects.
* **Custom Resources (CR)**: API objects managed by Operators, allowing users to add CRs to namespaces once installed.
* **Resource Instances**: Instances created from CRs within namespaces to enable Operator functionality.

## Operator Sources

The platform supports five Operator sources:

### Alauda

Provided and maintained by Alauda, with full lifecycle management, security updates, technical support, and SLA commitment.

### Curated

Curated from open-source communities, kept consistent with community versions without code modifications or recompilation. Alauda provides guidance and security updates when needed but does not commit to SLA or lifecycle management.

### Community

Provided by open-source communities with periodic updates to ensure deployability but without functionality guarantees. No SLA and no Alauda support.

### Marketplace

Provided and maintained by Alauda-certified third-party vendors. Alauda supports platform integration, while the vendor retains core responsibility.

### Custom

Developed and uploaded by users to meet custom business or cluster management needs.

## Installation Process

1. Log into the Web Console and switch to the **Administrator** view.
2. Navigate to **Marketplace > OperatorHub**.
3. If "Absent":
   * Download the Operator package from the Custom Portal or contact technical support.
   * Use `violet` to upload the package to the target cluster. See [CLI documentation](../ui/cli_tools/index.mdx).
   * Navigate to **Marketplace > Upload Packages**, switch to the **Operator** tab, and confirm upload.
4. If "Ready", click **Install**. Refer to the Operator's user documentation for usage instructions.

## Upgrade Process

1. Upload the new Operator version.
2. The upgrade will follow the configured strategy:
   * **Automatic Upgrade**: Upgrades automatically after upload.
   * **Manual Upgrade**:
     * **Batch Upgrade**: Via **Platform Management > Cluster Management > Clusters > Features**.
     * **Individual Upgrade**: Approve the upgrade in OperatorHub.

> **Note:**
>
> * "Alauda" sourced Operators require manual upgrades.
> * Only "Alauda" sourced Operators support batch upgrades.

## Support

Contact technical support if you encounter issues during installation or upgrade.
