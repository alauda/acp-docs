# Operator

## Overview

Operators are a method for packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications, capable of managing the entire lifecycle of Kubernetes resources.

## Introduction

An Operator is a method for packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications that can automate the entire application lifecycle (e.g., creation, updates, deletion). Platform administrators can deploy Operators from the OperatorHub on a per-cluster basis.

## Key Concepts

* **OperatorHub**: Presented as a web console interface that displays a list of available Operators on the platform. Through OperatorHub, platform administrators can view Operator descriptions and detailed information, as well as install and manage Operators.

* **Resources**: CRD ([CustomResourceDefinition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/)) resources owned by an Operator. In the Kubernetes API, a CRD resource is an endpoint for storing a collection of API objects (CR, Custom Resource) of a specific type.

* **Custom Resources (CR)**: Specific types of API objects created by CRDs that are owned by Operators deployed to the cluster. After successful Operator installation, users in all cluster-associated projects are allowed to add CRs to their namespaces.

* **Resource Instances**: Resource instances created in a namespace by calling the Kubernetes API based on a CR. Creating resource instances provides Operator capabilities to the namespace.

## Installation Process

1. In the platform management view, click on the left navigation menu: **Platform Management** > **Marketplace** > **OperatorHub** to view all Operators provided by the platform.

2. Locate your desired Operator. If the Operator shows an "absent" status, you will need to:
   - Visit the Custom Portal to download the corresponding Operator package. If you don't have access to the Custom Portal, contact technical support.
   - Use the `violet` tool to publish the package to the cluster where you want to install the Operator. For detailed instructions on using this tool, refer to the [CLI documentation](/ui/cli_tools/index.mdx).
   - Navigate to **Platform Management** > **Marketplace** > **Upload Packages**, switch to the **Operator** tab, and locate the uploaded Operator name. The Operator details page will display the version(s) of the package uploaded to the platform.

3. If the Operator shows a "ready" status, click **Install** to begin the installation process. For specific usage instructions after installation, please refer to the user documentation for that particular Operator.

## Upgrading Operators

To upgrade an existing Operator to a newer version:

1. Upload the new Operator version to the platform using the same process described in the installation section.

2. Navigate to **Platform Management** > **Marketplace** > **Upload Packages**, switch to the **Operator** tab, and check the package details of the corresponding Operator to confirm the new version has been uploaded.

3. The upgrade behavior depends on the Operator subscription's upgrade strategy:

   - **Automatic Upgrade Strategy**: If the upgrade strategy is set to automatic, the Operator will upgrade automatically once the new version package is uploaded.

   - **Manual Upgrade Strategy**: If the upgrade strategy is set to manual, you have two options:
     - **Batch Upgrade**: To upgrade multiple Operators under a cluster, navigate to **Platform Management** > **Clusters** > **Clusters**. Clusters with installed Operators that can be upgraded will display an upgrade icon. Enter the cluster details, switch to the **Features** tab, and click the activated upgrade button to perform a batch upgrade of multiple Operators.
     - **Individual Upgrade**: To upgrade only a specific Operator, check the OperatorHub details for that Operator. You will see a prompt waiting for approval. After you approve, the Operator will begin the upgrade process.

**Note**: Operators with a source labeled as "Alauda" cannot have their subscription upgrade strategy set to automatic. These must be upgraded manually.

## Support

If you encounter any issues during the installation or upgrade process, please contact technical support for assistance.
