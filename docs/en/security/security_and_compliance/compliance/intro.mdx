# Introduction

## Introduction

Compliance management is a core feature of the platform designed to ensure cluster security and compliance. It leverages popular compliance management tools such as Kubernetes PSA, Gatekeeper, and Kyverno to deploy plugins in clusters. By integrating with predefined security policies and compliance policies, it provides a unified management system for multi-cluster configuration resources. Through compliance management, you can effectively ensure that all resources in the cluster are configured in accordance with the organization's security standards.

## Advantages

Compliance management module has the following core advantages:

- Multi-tool integration

  Integrates the three mainstream compliance management tools of Kubernetes PSA, Gatekeeper, and Kyverno, providing comprehensive compliance management capabilities for users

- Multi-level security control

  Provides P0 (must implement), P1 (strongly recommended), and P2 (recommended) three security levels of strategies, meeting the security needs of different scenarios

- Flexible strategy management

  Supports cluster-level and namespace-level strategy management, and different execution modes (enforcement, audit, warning, etc.) can be set according to needs

- Unified management interface

  Provides an intuitive interface to view the compliance status of each cluster, including detailed information about non-compliant resources and compliance rules

## Scenarios

The main application scenarios of compliance management are as follows:

- Security baseline management
  
  Ensure all clusters meet basic security requirements through predefined security policies, such as prohibiting privileged containers and restricting container permissions

- Resource specification management

  Mandate that resource configurations comply with organizational standards, such as enforcing resource limits and health checks

- Multi-cluster unified management

  Implement a unified security strategy across multiple clusters to ensure all clusters meet the same security standards

- Compliance audit

  Monitor cluster violations through audit mode to promptly identify and handle security issues

## Limitations

When using the compliance management feature, please note the following limitations:

- The corresponding compliance management components need to be deployed in the target cluster
- Some advanced policies may affect cluster performance
- Certain system critical namespaces (such as kube-system) may require special policy exemptions
- Policy enforcement may impact the deployment of existing workloads, so it is recommended to use the audit mode for testing first
