# Introduction

ACP provides compliance functionality based on the open-source Kyverno component, enabling organizations to define and enforce policies across their Kubernetes clusters. 

This feature addresses the challenge of maintaining consistent security, governance, and operational standards by allowing users to create custom policies using Kyverno's YAML syntax and automatically validate resources against these policies. 

The compliance functionality provides comprehensive violation monitoring and reporting capabilities, offering both resource-level and policy-level views of compliance violations through an intuitive interface, helping teams quickly identify non-compliant resources and take appropriate remediation actions to maintain their desired security posture and regulatory compliance.
