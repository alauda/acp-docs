# Introduction

## Product Introduction

ACP API Refiner is a data filtering service provided by the Alauda Container Platform that enhances multi-tenant security and data isolation in Kubernetes environments. It filters Kubernetes API response data based on user permissions, projects, clusters, and namespaces, while also supporting field-level filtering, inclusion, and data desensitization.


## Limitations

The following limitations apply to ACP API Refiner:

- Resources must contain specific tenant-related labels for data isolation:

  - `cpaas.io/project`
  - `cpaas.io/cluster`
  - `cpaas.io/namespace`
  - `kubernetes.io/metadata.name`
  - Optional: `cpaas.io/creator`

- LabelSelector queries do not support logical OR operations
- Platform-level userbindings are not filtered
- Filtering is only applied to GET and LIST API operations
