# Introduction

## Product Introduction

ACP API Refiner is a data filtering service provided by the ACP platform that enhances multi-tenant security and data isolation in Kubernetes environments. It filters Kubernetes API response data based on user permissions, projects, clusters, and namespaces, while also supporting field-level filtering, inclusion, and data desensitization.

## Product Advantages

The core advantages of ACP API Refiner are as follows:

- **Multi-dimensional Data Isolation**
  - Supports filtering API responses based on project, cluster, and namespace dimensions
  - Ensures proper data boundaries between different tenants
  - Prevents unauthorized access to cluster-scoped resources

- **Flexible Data Filtering**
  - Supports excluding, including, and desensitizing specific fields in API responses
  - Configurable filtering rules through YAML configuration
  - Dynamic generation of resource Ingress for different resource types

- **Enhanced Security**
  - Implements JWT token-based user authentication
  - Provides fine-grained access control based on user permissions
  - Supports data desensitization for sensitive information

## Scenarios

The main application scenarios of ACP API Refiner are as follows:

- **Multi-tenant Environment**
  - Ensures proper data isolation between different tenants
  - Prevents unauthorized access to cluster-scoped resources
  - Manages shared namespace scenarios effectively

- **Sensitive Data Protection**
  - Filters sensitive information from API responses
  - Supports field-level data desensitization
  - Protects sensitive metadata and annotations

- **Compliance Requirements**
  - Helps meet data isolation requirements
  - Supports audit and compliance needs
  - Maintains data access boundaries

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to ACP API Refiner:

- Resources must contain specific tenant-related labels for data isolation:
  - `cpaas.io/project`
  - `cpaas.io/cluster`
  - `cpaas.io/namespace`
  - `kubernetes.io/metadata.name`
  - Optional: `cpaas.io/creator`

- LabelSelector queries do not support logical OR operations
- Platform-level userbindings are not filtered
- Filtering is only applied to GET and LIST API operations
