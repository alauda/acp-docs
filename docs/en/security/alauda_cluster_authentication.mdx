# Alauda Cluster Authentication

The Alauda Container Platform Cluster Authentication plugin provides an independent authentication integration capability for global cluster failure scenarios.

When the `global` cluster fails, users can still log in through this service to access and operate Kubernetes clusters, maintaining permissions consistent with the state before the global cluster failure.
