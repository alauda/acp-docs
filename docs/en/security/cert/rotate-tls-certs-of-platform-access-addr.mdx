# Rotate TLS Certs of Platform Access Addresses

:::info
For <Term name="productShort" /> version v4.0.x, apply the same procedure to both the primary cluster and the standby cluster (terms of the Disaster Recovery setup) as described here.
:::

## Prerequisites

* A pair of TLS certificates and its private key.

## Procedures

1. On any control-plane node in the global cluster, export backups of the TLS certificates used by <Term name="productShort" />'s platform access addresses:
```shell
kubectl get certificate -n cpaas-system dex-serving-cert --ignore-not-found=true -o yaml > /cpaas/dex-serving-cert.yaml
kubectl get secret -n cpaas-system dex.tls -o yaml > /cpaas/dex.tls.yaml
```
 
2. Delete the current certificates:
```shell
kubectl delete certificate -n cpaas-system dex-serving-cert --ignore-not-found=true
kubectl delete secret -n cpaas-system dex.tls
```
 
3. Introduce the new certificate:
```shell
kubectl create secret tls dex.tls --cert=/path/to/tls.crt --key=/path/to/tls.key -n cpaas-system
```
