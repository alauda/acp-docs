# OLM Certificates

All certificates for **Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)** components — including `olm-operator`, `catalog-operator`, `packageserver`, and `marketplace-operator` — are automatically managed by the system.

When installing Operators that define **webhooks** or **API services** in their **ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)** object, OLM automatically generates and rotates the required certificates.
