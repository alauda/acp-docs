# cert-manager

Each cluster will automatically deploy **Certificate for cert-manager**

**cert-manager** is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller that automatically generates and manages TLS certificates based on `Certificate` resources. Many components in Kubernetes clusters use cert-manager to manage their TLS certificates, ensuring secure communication.

## Overview

Cert-manager manages the lifecycle of certificates through Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):

- **Certificate**: Defines the certificates that need to be managed
- **Issuer/ClusterIssuer**: Defines certificate issuers
- **CertificateRequest**: Internal resource for processing certificate requests

## How it works

When a `Certificate` resource is created, cert-manager automatically:
1. Generates private keys and certificate signing requests
2. Obtains signed certificates from the specified Issuer
3. Stores certificates and private keys in Kubernetes Secrets

Additionally, cert-manager monitors the validity period of certificates and renews them before they expire to ensure continuous service availability.

## Identifying cert-manager Managed Certificates

Certificates managed by cert-manager have corresponding `Secret` resources with type `kubernetes.io/tls` and specific labels and annotations.

### Common Labels and Annotations

`Secret` resources managed by cert-manager typically contain the following labels and annotations:

**Labels:**
- `controller.cert-manager.io/fao: "true"`: Identifies that this Secret is managed by cert-manager and enables filtered Secret caching by the controller.

**Annotations:**
- `cert-manager.io/certificate-name`: Certificate name
- `cert-manager.io/common-name`: Common name of the certificate
- `cert-manager.io/alt-names`: Alternative names of the certificate
- `cert-manager.io/ip-sans`: IP addresses of the certificate
- `cert-manager.io/issuer-kind`: Type of certificate issuer
- `cert-manager.io/issuer-name`: Name of certificate issuer
- `cert-manager.io/issuer-group`: API group of the issuer
- `cert-manager.io/uri-sans`: URI Subject Alternative Names
