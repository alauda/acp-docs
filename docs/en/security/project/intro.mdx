# Introduction

This article provides an overview of the platform's interface distribution and common operations to help you better manage your projects.

## Project
A project is a resource isolation unit that enables multi-tenant usage scenarios in enterprises. It divides resources from one or more clusters into isolated environments, ensuring both resource and personnel isolation. Projects can represent different subsidiaries, departments, or project teams within an enterprise. Through project management, you can achieve:
- Resource isolation between project teams
- Quota management within tenants
- Efficient resource allocation and control

## Namespaces
Namespaces are smaller, mutually isolated resource spaces within a project. They serve as workspaces for users to implement their production workloads. Key characteristics of namespaces include:
- Multiple namespaces can be created under a project
- Total resource quota of all namespaces cannot exceed the project quota
- Resource quotas are allocated more granularly at the namespace level
- Container sizes (CPU, memory) are limited at the namespace level
- Improved resource utilization through fine-grained control

## Relationship Between Clusters, Projects, and Namespaces

The platform's resource hierarchy follows these rules:

* A project can utilize resources (CPU, memory, storage) from multiple clusters, and a cluster can allocate resources to multiple projects.

* Multiple namespaces can be created under a project, with their combined resource quotas not exceeding the total project resources.

* A namespace's resource quota must come from a single cluster, and a namespace can only belong to one project.
