# Manage Project Cluster

This guide explains how to manage cluster associations for a project. You can add clusters to allocate their resources to the project, or remove clusters to reclaim the allocated resources.

## Introduction

You can add clusters to a project to allocate their resources, or remove clusters to reclaim the allocated resources. This functionality is useful in the following scenarios:

* When project resources are insufficient for business operations
* When a newly created or added cluster needs to be allocated to an existing project
* When cluster resources need to be reclaimed from a project
* When a specific project needs exclusive access to a cluster

## Add a Cluster

Add a cluster to a project and set its resource quota.

### Procedure

1. In the **Project Management** view, click on the project name where you want to add the cluster.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Details**.

3. Click **Actions** > **Add Cluster** in the upper right corner.

4. Select the cluster and set the resource quota to be allocated to the current project. The following resources can be configured:
   - CPU (cores)
   - Memory (Gi)
   - Storage (Gi)
   - PVC count (number)
   - Pods (number)
   - vGPU (virtual GPU)/MPS/pGPU (physical GPU, cores)
   - Video memory quota

:::note
* GPU resource quota can only be configured when GPU plugins are deployed in the cluster.<br/><br/>When GPU resources are **GPU-Manager or MPS GPU**, **vMemory** quota can also be configured.<br/><br/>**GPU Units**: 100 units of virtual cores are equivalent to 1 physical core (1 pGPU = 1 core = 100 GPU-Manager core = 100 MPS core), and pGPU units can only be allocated in whole numbers. GPU-Manager 1 unit of memory is equal to 256 Mi, MPS GPU 1 unit of memory is equal to 1 Gi, and 1024 Mi = 1 Gi.

* If no quota is set for a certain type of resource, it defaults to **Unlimited**. This means that the project can use the available resources of the corresponding type in the cluster as needed, without a maximum limit.

* The value of the project quota set should be within the quota range displayed on the page. Under each resource quota input box, the allocated quota and total amount of that resource will be displayed for reference.
:::

5. Click **Add**.

## Remove a Cluster

Remove a cluster associated with a project.

:::warning
* After removing a cluster, the project cannot use the business resources under the removed cluster.

* When the cluster to be removed is abnormal, the resources under the abnormal cluster cannot be cleaned up. It is recommended to fix the cluster before removing it.

### Procedure

1. In the **Project Management** view, click on the project name where you want to remove the cluster.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Details**.

3. Click **Actions** > **Remove Cluster** in the upper right corner.

4. In the pop-up **Remove Cluster** dialog box, enter the name of the cluster to be removed, and then click the **Remove** button to successfully remove the cluster.
