# Create Project

Before your project team starts working, you can create a project based on the existing cluster resources on the platform. The project will be isolated from other projects (tenants) in terms of both resources and personnel. When creating a project, you can allocate resources according to your project scale and actual business needs. The project can utilize resources from multiple clusters on the platform.

:::warning

When creating a project, the platform will automatically create a namespace with the same name as the project in the associated clusters to isolate platform-level resources. Please do not modify this namespace or its resources.

## Procedure

1. In the **Project Management** view, click **Create Project**.

2. On the **Basic information** page, configure the following parameters:

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | **Name** | The name of the project, which cannot be the same as an existing project name or any name in the project name blacklist. Otherwise, the project cannot be created.<br/><br/>**Note**: The project name blacklist includes special namespace names under platform clusters: `cpaas-system`, `cert-manager`, `default`, `global-credentials`, `kube-ovn`, `kube-public`, `kube-system`, `nsx-system`, `alauda-system`, `kube-federation-system`, `ALL-ALL`, and `true`. |
    | **Cluster** | The cluster(s) associated with the project, where the administrator can allocate resource quotas. Click the drop-down selection box to select one or more clusters.<br/><br/>**Note**: Clusters in abnormal state cannot be selected. |

3. Click **Next** and in the project quota setting step, read  [Manage Resource Quotas](./project_quota.mdx) to set the resource quotas to be allocated to the current project for the selected clusters.
