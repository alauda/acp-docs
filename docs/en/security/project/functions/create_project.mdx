:::tip
Before your project team starts working, you can create a project based on the existing cluster resources on the platform. The project will be isolated from other projects (tenants) in terms of both resources and personnel. When creating a project, you can allocate resources according to your project scale and actual business needs. The project can utilize resources from multiple clusters on the platform.

# Create Project

:::warning

When creating a project, the platform will automatically create a namespace with the same name as the project in the associated clusters to isolate platform-level resources. Please do not modify this namespace or its resources.
:::


## Procedure

1. In the **Project Management** view, click **Create Project**.

2. On the **Basic information** page, configure the following parameters:

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | **Name** | The name of the project, which cannot be the same as an existing project name or any name in the project name blacklist. Otherwise, the project cannot be created.<br/><br/>**Note**: The project name blacklist includes special namespace names under platform clusters: `cpaas-system`, `cert-manager`, `default`, `global-credentials`, `kube-ovn`, `kube-public`, `kube-system`, `nsx-system`, `alauda-system`, `kube-federation-system`, `ALL-ALL`, and `true`. |
    | **Cluster** | The cluster(s) associated with the project, where the administrator can allocate resource quotas. Click the drop-down selection box to select one or more clusters.<br/><br/>**Note**: Clusters in abnormal state cannot be selected. |

3. Click **Next** and in the project quota setting step, set the resource quotas to be allocated to the current project for the selected clusters. This includes:
   - CPU (cores)
   - Memory (Gi)
   - Storage (Gi)
   - PVC count (number)
   - Pods (number)
   - Virtual GPU (GPU-Manager/MPS)
   - pGPU (physical GPU, cores)
   - GPU memory

:::note


    * GPU resource quotas can only be configured when GPU plugins are deployed in the cluster. When the GPU resource is a **GPU-Manager or MPS GPU**, the **vMemory** quota can also be configured.<br/><br/>**GPU Units**: 100 units of virtual cores are equivalent to 1 physical core (1 pGPU = 1 core = 100 GPU-Manager core = 100 MPS core), and pGPU units can only be allocated in whole numbers. GPU-Manager 1 unit of memory is equal to 256 Mi, MPS GPU 1 unit of memory is equal to 1 Gi, and 1024 Mi = 1 Gi.

    * If no quota is set for a certain type of resource, it defaults to **Unlimited**. This means that the project can use the available resources of the corresponding type in the cluster as needed, without a maximum limit.

    * The project quota values set should be within the quota range displayed on the page. Under each resource quota input box, the allocated quota and total information for that resource will be displayed for reference.
