# Manage Project Members

## Import Members

You can grant users operation permissions for the project and its namespaces by importing existing platform users or adding OIDC users. You can assign roles such as project administrators, namespace administrators, developers, or custom roles with project and namespace management permissions.

### Constraints and Limitations

* When no OIDC IDP is configured on the platform:
    * Only existing platform users can be imported as project members, including:
        * OIDC users who have successfully logged in
        * Users synchronized through LDAP
        * Local users
        * Users added to other projects as OIDC users (with source marked as `-`)

* When an OIDC IDP is configured:
    * You can add valid OIDC accounts that meet the input requirements
    * Account validity cannot be verified during addition
    * Ensure the account is valid, or it won't be able to log in normally

* System default administrator users and the currently logged-in user cannot be imported

### Procedure

1. In the **Project Management** view, click on the project name to be managed.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Members**.
