# Introduction

## IDP Introduction

> This guide helps you understand the IDP (Identity Provider) configuration feature of the platform.

The platform integrates with the Dex identity authentication service, allowing you to use Dex's pre-implemented connectors for platform account authentication through IDP configuration. For more information, refer to the [Dex official documentation](https://github.com/dexidp/dex).

### LDAP Integration

If your enterprise manages users through **LDAP** (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), you can configure LDAP on the platform to connect your enterprise's LDAP server. This enables:

- Communication between the platform and your LDAP server
- Enterprise users to log in to the platform using their LDAP credentials
- Automatic synchronization of enterprise user accounts to the platform

### OIDC Integration

The platform supports integration with IDP services using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol for third-party user authentication. If your enterprise uses an IDP for user authentication, you can configure OIDC on the platform to enable users to log in using their third-party accounts.
