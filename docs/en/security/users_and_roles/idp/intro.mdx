# Introduction

## IDP Introduction

> Helps you understand the IDP configuration feature of the platform.

The platform supports dex identity authentication service and can use the connectors already implemented by dex for authentication of accounts on the platform by configuring IDP (Identity Provider) (please refer to the [dex official documentation](https://github.com/dexidp/dex)).

If your enterprise manages users (accounts) through **LDAP** (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), you can add LDAP on the platform to connect your enterprise's LDAP to the platform, allowing the platform to communicate with the LDAP server to allow enterprise users to log in to the platform and authenticate their identities when logging in. 

By synchronizing LDAP, the enterprise's user accounts are synchronized to the platform, and the synchronized users can use their enterprise accounts to log in to the platform.

The platform supports integration with IDP services using the OIDC protocol for authentication of third-party users. If your enterprise uses IDP for user authentication, you can add OIDC on the platform to allow your users to log in to the platform using third-party accounts authenticated by IDP.

If you need to use other connectors to authenticate accounts on this platform, please contact technical support personnel.
