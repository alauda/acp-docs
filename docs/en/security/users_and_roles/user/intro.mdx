# Introduction

## Source of Users

* Local users: These include the administrator account automatically created when the platform is deployed, accounts created through the platform, and users added through the local dex configuration file.

* Third-party users

    * LDAP users synchronized to the platform: These are enterprise users whose accounts are imported into the platform's user system by synchronizing with an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server added through an IDP (Identity Provider) integration on the platform. The source is displayed as the name of the IDP configuration. LDAP can be integrated through IDP configuration.



    * OIDC users: These are third-party platform users who log in to the platform through the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol and are recognized by the platform. The source is displayed as the name of the IDP configuration. OIDC can be integrated through IDP configuration.**Caution**: OIDC users created by adding members to a project are displayed as "-" until they successfully log in to the platform for verification. After successful login, the source is displayed as the name of the IDP configuration.

* Other third-party platform users: These are accounts authenticated by dex connectors that have been implemented and supported by the platform, such as GitHub and Microsoft. For more information, please refer to the [dex official documentation](https://github.com/dexidp/dex).

## Constraints and limitations



* When creating a local user, the username cannot be the same as an existing user (local or third-party) on the platform.

* When a third-party user (OIDC or LDAP) added through IDP integration has the same username as an existing user (local or third-party) on the platform, the users with the same name are automatically associated, and their permissions are consistent with the existing user. They can log in to the platform through their respective sources.

* Only one user record with the same name is displayed in the platform user list, and the source depends on the most recent login method (local or the name configured by the ***IDP***).

## User life cycle

The status of users on the platform is described in the following table.

| Status   | Description                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| **normal**  | The user account is valid and can log in to the platform. |
| **Disabled**  | The user account is disabled and cannot log in to the platform. Contact the platform administrator to activate the account. The possible reasons for being disabled are as follows: The user account is within the validity period, but has not logged in to the platform for more than 90 consecutive days; The user account has expired; The user account has been disabled by the platform administrator. |
| **Locked**  | The account within the validity period will be locked if the username/password is entered incorrectly for 5 consecutive times within 24 hours. The lockout period lasts for 20 minutes, during which the account cannot be used to log in to the platform. After the account is unlocked, it can be used to log in to the platform again. During the lockout period, the platform administrator can manually unlock the account. |
| **Invalid**  | When synchronizing with the already connected LDAP on the platform again, the status of the user account that has been deleted in the LDAP is displayed as invalid, and the invalid account cannot log in to the platform. |
