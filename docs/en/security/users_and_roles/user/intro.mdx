# Introduction

:::tip

The platform supports user authentication and login verification for all users.

:::

## User Sources

### Local Users
- Administrator account created during platform deployment
- Accounts created through the platform interface
- Users added through local dex configuration file

### Third-Party Users

#### LDAP Users
- Enterprise users synchronized from LDAP servers
- Accounts are imported through IDP (Identity Provider) integration
- Source is displayed as the IDP configuration name
- Integration is configured through IDP settings

#### OIDC Users
- Third-party platform users authenticated via OIDC protocol
- Source is displayed as the IDP configuration name
- Integration is configured through IDP settings

:::warning

For OIDC users added to a project before their first login:
- Source is displayed as "-" until successful platform login
- After successful login, source changes to the IDP configuration name

:::

#### Other Third-Party Users
- Users authenticated through supported dex connectors (e.g., GitHub, Microsoft)
- For more information, refer to the [dex official documentation](https://github.com/dexidp/dex)

## User Management Rules

:::warning

Please note the following important rules:

- Local usernames must be unique across all user types
- Third-party users (OIDC/LDAP) with matching usernames are automatically associated
- Associated users inherit permissions from existing accounts
- Users can log in through their respective sources
- Only one user record is displayed per username in the platform
- User source is determined by the most recent login method

## User Lifecycle

The following table describes different user statuses on the platform:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Normal** | User account is active and can log in to the platform |
| **Disabled** | User account is inactive and cannot log in. Contact platform administrator for activation.<br/><br/>Possible reasons:<br/>- No login for 90+ consecutive days<br/>- Account expiration<br/>- Manual disable by administrator |
| **Locked** | Account is temporarily locked due to 5 failed login attempts within 24 hours.<br/><br/>Details:<br/>- Lock duration: 20 minutes<br/>- Can be manually unlocked by administrator<br/>- Account becomes available after lock period |
| **Invalid** | LDAP-synchronized account that has been deleted from the LDAP server.<br/><br/>Note: Invalid accounts cannot log in to the platform |
