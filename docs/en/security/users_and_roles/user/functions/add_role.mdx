# Manage User Roles

Platform administrators can manage roles for other users (not their own account) to grant or revoke permissions. After the RBAC refactor, role assignments are split into **Platform Roles** (system templates) and **Kubernetes Roles** (native RoleBinding objects).

## Assign Platform Roles (System Templates)

Use this tab to bind or unbind the predefined platform/project/namespace roles that the product ships with.

### Steps

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Users** > **User Management**.
2. Click the username of the target user.
3. Open the **Platform Roles** tab.
4. Click **Add Role**.
5. In the dialog:
   - Select a role from the **Role Name** dropdown.
   - Choose the scope (Cluster / Project / Namespace) if prompted.
   - Click **Add**.

:::note
Notes for platform roles:
- Only the predefined system roles are available here; they cannot be edited or duplicated.
- A role can only be bound once per scope. Already-bound roles are disabled in the dropdown.
- The built-in Cluster Administrator role cannot be reassigned for the global cluster.
:::

### Remove Platform Roles

1. Stay on the **Platform Roles** tab.
2. Click **Remove** next to the role you want to unbind.
3. Confirm the removal.

## Bind Kubernetes Roles (RoleBinding / ClusterRoleBinding)

Use this tab to grant fine-grained permissions through native Kubernetes roles that exist inside specific clusters.

### Steps

1. On the user detail page, switch to the **Kubernetes Roles** tab.
2. Click **Add RoleBinding**.
3. Configure the binding:
   - **Cluster**: Target cluster that hosts the role.
   - **Binding Type**: `RoleBinding` (namespace scope) or `ClusterRoleBinding`.
   - **Namespace**: Required when `RoleBinding` is selected.
   - **Role Name**: Choose an existing `Role` or `ClusterRole`.
   - **Subject**: Confirm the current user as the binding subject.
4. Click **Create**.

### Remove Kubernetes RoleBindings

1. Remain on the **Kubernetes Roles** tab.
2. Locate the binding (filter by cluster, namespace, or role if needed).
3. Click **Remove** and confirm.

:::warning
Role management permissions:
- Only platform administrators can manage other users' roles.
- Users cannot modify roles or bindings for their own account.
