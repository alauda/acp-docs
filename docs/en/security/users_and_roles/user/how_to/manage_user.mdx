# Managing Users

This article will introduce you to the related functions of user management.

The platform provides flexible user management methods, supporting the management of individual specified users. At the same time, to improve the efficiency of user management in specific scenarios (such as on-site or off-site outsourcing teams), batch operations are supported to update the validity period, activate, disable, or delete users.



**Caution**:

* The system-generated account cannot be managed. The role of this account is a platform administrator, and the source is local, which is unique on the platform.

* The account of the currently logged-in user cannot be managed.  If you need to modify the display name and password of your own account, please go to the personal information page to perform relevant operations.
