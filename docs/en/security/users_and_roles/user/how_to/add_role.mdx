# Add roles for users

Platform administrators can add roles for specified users outside of their own accounts, granting corresponding permissions to those users. They can also remove roles from specified users outside of their own accounts, revoking corresponding permissions.

## Procedure


1. In the left navigation pane, click **Users** > **User Management**.



3. Click the ***user name*** to whom you want to add roles.

4. Scroll down to the **Role List** section and click **Add Role**.

5. In the pop-up dialog box for adding roles.

    **Note**: You can repeat this step to add multiple roles for the user.

6. Select a system role or custom role to add from the ***Role Name*** drop-down list.

    **Note**: The same role can only be added once for the same user. The roles that the user already has will be displayed in the drop-down list but cannot be selected.

7. After selecting the scope of the role's permissions (cluster, project, or namespace), click **Add**.

    **Tip**: It is not possible to assign the **Cluster Administrator** role for the global cluster to a user.


## Unbind

1. In the left navigation pane, click **Users** > **User Management**.

2. Click the ***user name*** from whom you want to remove roles.

3. Scroll down to the **Role List** section, click **Remove** next to the role you want to remove, and confirm.

:::tip

Only users with the platform administrator role have the permission to add/remove roles for other users. Also, it is not possible to manage the roles of one's own account.
