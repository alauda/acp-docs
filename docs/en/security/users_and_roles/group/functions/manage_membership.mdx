# Manage Local User Group Membership

Only users with Platform Management permissions can manage local user group memberships.

## Prerequisites

:::warning

Before managing group memberships, please note the following limitations:

- Only users with Platform Management permissions can manage groups and their members
- System accounts and currently logged-in accounts cannot be managed (imported to or removed from groups)
- Each local user group can have a maximum of 5000 members
- When a group reaches the 5000-member limit, no further imports are allowed

:::

## Import Members

You can import users from the platform into local user groups for unified permission management.

:::tip

Users imported into a group will automatically inherit all operational permissions assigned to that group.

### Steps

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Users** > **User Group Management**
2. Click the name of the local user group where you want to add members
3. On the **Group Member Management** tab, click **Import Member**
4. Select one or more users from the platform by checking the boxes next to their usernames/display names
5. Click **Import**

:::note

- You can only select users who are not currently members of the group
- Use the **Import All** button to import all users in the list at once

:::

## Remove Members

When you remove a user from a group, all operational permissions granted to that user through the group will be automatically revoked.

### Steps

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Users** > **User Group Management**
2. Click the name of the local user group where you want to remove members
3. On the **Group Member Management** tab, you can remove members in two ways:
