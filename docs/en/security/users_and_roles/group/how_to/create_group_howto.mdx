## Create a local user group

|Operation| Description                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|**Update user groups**| When the user group's **Source** is `Local`, you can update the name and description of the user group. When the user group's source is *`IDP name`*, you can only update the description of the user group. |
|**Delete the local user group**| You can delete user groups with a **Source** of `Local`.


:::tip

When a group is deleted, its members and roles are automatically removed.
