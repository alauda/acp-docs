# Manage the membership of local user groups

## Introduction

Support users with Platform Management permissions to manage members of local user groups.


## Constraints and limitations

* Only users with Platform Management permissions can manage groups and their members. However, it is not possible to manage (import local groups or remove from groups) system accounts or currently logged-in accounts.

* A local user group can manage up to 5000 users. When the number of group members reaches the limit (5000), further imports are not allowed.

## Import a member

Support importing users from the platform into user groups with the **Source** set to `Local` for unified permission management.

**Tip**: Users imported into the group will automatically have the operational permissions of the user group.

### Procedure of operation

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Users** > **User group management**.

2. Click the ***Local user group name*** to which you want to add members.

3. On the **Group Member Management** tab, click **Import a member**.

4. Click the checkbox in front of the username/display name to select one or more users from the platform, then click **Import**.

   **Tip**:

   * You can only select users who are not currently in the group.

   * Click **Import all** to import all users in the list.

## Remove a member

When a user is removed from a group, the operational permissions assigned to that member by the group will be automatically revoked.

### Procedure of operation

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Users** > **User group management**.

2. Click the ***Local user group name*** from which you want to remove members.

3. On the **Group Member Management** tab, click **Remove** next to the member you want to remove and confirm.

   **Or**: Click the checkbox in front of the username/display name to select one or more members, then click **Batch remove** and confirm.
