# Introduction

## Group Introduction

The platform supports managing users on the platform through user groups. By managing the roles of the group, you can easily issue (or revoke) the same platform operation permissions to multiple users in the group, achieving batch user-based role-based access control.

For example, when there are personnel changes within an enterprise and new project or namespace operation permissions need to be issued to multiple users in batches, creating a user group and importing relevant users as members into the group, and configuring the corresponding project and namespace roles for the group can configure unified permissions for all group members.

## Type of group

There are two types of groups on the platform:



* **Local user group**: User groups created on the platform.

    * The source of the group is displayed as **Local**.

    * The group can be updated or deleted.

    * Users from any source can be imported (or removed) into the group.

    * Roles can be added (or removed) to the group.

* **User group synchronized from IDP**: Groups synchronized from the IDP (LDAP, Azure AD) that the platform is connected to.

    * The source of the group is displayed as the name of the ***IDP*** that the platform is connected to.

    * The group name cannot be updated or deleted.

    * Group members cannot be managed (imported or removed).

    * Roles can be added (or removed) to the group.
