# Introduction

## Group Introduction

The platform supports user management through user groups. By managing group roles, you can efficiently:
- Grant platform operation permissions to multiple users simultaneously
- Revoke permissions from multiple users at once
- Implement batch role-based access control

For example, when personnel changes occur within an enterprise and you need to grant new project or namespace operation permissions to multiple users, you can:
1. Create a user group
2. Import relevant users as group members
3. Configure project and namespace roles for the group
4. Apply unified permissions to all group members

## Group Types

The platform supports two types of groups:

### Local User Group
- Created directly on the platform
- Source is displayed as **Local**
- Can be updated or deleted
- Supports:
  - Adding or removing users from any source
  - Adding or removing roles

### IDP-Synchronized User Group
- Synchronized from connected IDP (LDAP, Azure AD)
- Source is displayed as the connected ***IDP*** name
- Cannot be updated or deleted
- Supports:
  - Adding or removing roles
  - Cannot manage group members (add or remove)
