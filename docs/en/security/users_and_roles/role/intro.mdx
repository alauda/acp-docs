# Introduction

## Role Introduction

The platform's user role management is implemented using Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). This system enables flexible permission configuration by associating roles with users.

A role represents a collection of permissions for operating Kubernetes resources on the platform. These permissions include:
- Creating resources
- Viewing resources
- Updating resources
- Deleting resources

Roles classify and combine permissions for different resources. By assigning roles to users and setting permission scopes, you can quickly grant resource operation permissions.

Permissions can be revoked just as easily by removing roles from users.

A role can have:
- One or more resource types
- One or more operation permissions
- Multiple users assigned to it

For example:
- Role A: Can only view and create projects
- Role B: Can create, view, update, and delete users, projects, and namespaces

## System Roles

To meet common permission configuration scenarios, the platform provides the following default system roles. These roles enable flexible access control for platform resources and efficient permission management for users.

| Role Name | Description | Role Level |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Platform Administrator** | Has full access to all business and resources on the platform | Platform |
| **Platform Auditors** | Can view all platform resources and operation records, but has no other permissions | Platform |
| **Cluster Administrator (Alpha)** | Manages and maintains cluster resources with full access to all cluster-level resources | Cluster |
| **Project Administrator** | Manages namespace administrators and namespace quotas | Project |
| **namespace-admin-system** | Manages namespace members and role assignments | Namespace |
| **Developers** | Develops, deploys, and maintains custom applications within namespaces | Namespace |

## Custom Roles

The platform supports custom roles to enhance resource access control scenarios. Custom roles offer several advantages over system roles:

- Flexible permission configuration
- Ability to update role permissions
- Option to delete roles when no longer needed

:::warning

Exercise caution when updating or deleting custom roles. Deleting a custom role will automatically revoke all permissions granted by that role to bound users.
