Users with platform role permissions can create custom roles with permissions that are less than or equal to their own role permissions based on actual usage scenarios. When creating a role, you can configure the platform functional module operation permissions or the access permissions of user-defined resources (Kubernetes CRD) for the role.

# Create Role

## Introduction


1. In the left navigation bar, click **Users** > **Roles**.

3. Click **Create Role**.

4. Configure the role **Basic information**.

    - **Role Type**: When assigning roles to users, the permission scope will be limited based on the role type.

        - **Platform Role**: Displays all platform permissions.


        
        - **Project Role**: Displays all permissions under Project Management, Container Platform, Service Mesh, DevOps, Middleware, App Store, and Cloud Edge Collaboration views.
    
        - **Namespace Role**: Displays all permissions under Project Management, Container Platform, Service Mesh, DevOps, Middleware, and App Store views.

4. Click **Next**.

## View Configuration

In the view configuration, you will control the role's permission to access the specified view. If it is not selected, the view will not be displayed in the top navigation of the role.

Note:

1. The size of your account's role permissions will limit whether you can configure certain view cards. For example, if the account used to create a custom role does not have the **Project Management** view permission in the role configuration, the **Project Management** view card will be grayed out when creating a role, and you can only create roles with the same or lower permissions as your own role.



2. If the **Show Entry** of a certain view is turned off in the **Products** function, the configuration of the view's permissions in the **Permission Configuration** step can still take effect, but the view cannot be accessed temporarily because the entry is hidden. After the entry is turned on later, the relevant permissions that have been selected can still be used normally.

## Configuration of permissions
    
1. Click **Add Custom Permission** in the upper left corner of the page, and configure the permissions for the role to operate custom resources (Kubernetes CRD) according to the following instructions.

    | Parameter        | Description |
    | ------------- | -------- |
    | **Group Name**     | The name of the permission group. The group name will be displayed below the permission module in the order of adding time. |
    | **Resource Name**  | The name of the resource. Enter the name of multiple custom resources by pressing Enter. |
    | **Operation Permission**  | The permission to operate the resource. |

3. Click **Create**.
