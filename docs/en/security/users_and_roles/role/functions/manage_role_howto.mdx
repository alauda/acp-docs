# Manage Roles After the RBAC Refactor

This guide explains how to work with roles in ACP 4.2 and later:

- View platform-provided roles (read-only) and download their YAML
- Update or delete native Kubernetes roles
- Manage RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding objects from the Roles UI or from user/user-group pages

## View Platform Roles (Read-Only)

Platform roles remain the canonical templates for core functionality.

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Users** > **Platform Roles**.
2. Use the list filters to locate a role. The **Role Type** column now shows `Platform`, `Project`, `Namespace`, or `Cluster`.
3. Click the role name to open the detail page.
4. Switch to the **YAML** tab to inspect the exact definition. Use **Download YAML** if you need to archive the spec.

::::note
Create/Copy/Update/Delete actions are intentionally disabled. To request changes, submit a role-template update to the owning product team.

## Update a Kubernetes Role

1. Navigate to **Users** > **Platform Roles** > **Kubernetes Roles**.
2. Search by name or label.
3. Click the role name, then open the **YAML** tab.
4. Click **Edit**, modify the manifest (labels, annotations, or `rules`), and click **Save**.
5. Review the **RoleBindings** tab to ensure existing bindings still meet your expectations.

## Delete a Kubernetes Role

1. On the **Kubernetes Roles** list, click the overflow menu (…) next to the role.
2. Select **Delete Role**.
3. Confirm the role name to proceed.

Deleting a role removes it from the cluster. You must also clean up any RoleBindings that referenced the role. The UI will show a warning if bindings are still present.

## Manage RoleBindings

### From the Role Perspective

1. Open a role (Role or ClusterRole) from the **Kubernetes Roles** tab.
2. Go to the **RoleBindings** tab.
3. Use the search bar (supports name and label filters) to locate existing bindings.
4. Actions:
   - **Create RoleBindings**: Launches the creation wizard.
   - **Update Role**: Opens the YAML editor for the role itself.
   - **Delete Binding**: Removes the RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding after confirmation.

### From Users or User Groups

1. Open **Users** (or **User Groups**) and select the desired entry.
2. Switch to the **Kubernetes Roles** tab.
3. Review all RoleBindings associated with the user/group across clusters.
4. Click **Add RoleBinding**, choose:
   - Cluster
   - Binding type (RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding)
   - Role/ClusterRole
   - Namespace (for RoleBinding)
   - Subject details
5. Save the binding.

This workflow complements the existing **Platform Roles** tab, which is still used to attach system roles to users.

## Best Practices

- Use staging clusters to validate YAML changes before applying them to production.
- Keep role definitions under version control (for example, export them into Git) so that changes remain auditable.
- When in doubt about required permissions, start from a system role`s YAML, copy it locally, and adapt it as a Kubernetes role through the new UI.
