# Create Role

Users with platform role permissions can create custom roles with permissions that are less than or equal to their own role permissions based on actual usage scenarios. When creating a role, you can configure:
- Platform functional module operation permissions
- Access permissions for user-defined resources (Kubernetes CRD)


## Basic Information Configuration

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Users** > **Roles**.
2. Click **Create Role**.
3. Configure the role's basic information:

### Role Type
When assigning roles to users, the permission scope will be limited based on the role type:

- **Platform Role**: Displays all platform permissions
- **Project Role**: Displays permissions under:
  - Project Management
  - Container Platform
  - Service Mesh
  - DevOps
  - Middleware
- **Namespace Role**: Displays permissions under:
  - Project Management
  - Container Platform
  - Service Mesh
  - DevOps
  - Middleware

4. Click **Next**.

## View Configuration

In the view configuration section, you control the role's permission to access specified views. Views that are not selected will not be displayed in the top navigation for users with this role.

:::note

1. Your account's role permissions limit which view cards you can configure. For example:
   - If your account doesn't have the **Project Management** view permission
   - The **Project Management** view card will be grayed out when creating a role
   - You can only create roles with permissions equal to or lower than your own role

2. View Entry Status:
   - If a view's **Show Entry** is turned off in the **Products** function
   - The view's permissions in **Permission Configuration** will still take effect
   - The view will be temporarily inaccessible until the entry is enabled
   - Once enabled, the previously selected permissions will work normally
