# Alauda Container Security

Alauda Container Security is a comprehensive security solution designed for Kubernetes and containerized environments. It provides centralized management, automated vulnerability scanning, policy enforcement, and compliance checks to help organizations secure their container infrastructure across multiple clusters.

Alauda Container Security adopts a distributed, container-based architecture, consisting of Central Services (for management, API, and UI) and Secured Cluster Services (for monitoring, policy enforcement, and data collection). It integrates with CI/CD pipelines, SIEM, logging systems, and supports the built-in Scanner V4 vulnerability scanner.
