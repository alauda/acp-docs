# ACP Release Notes

## Minor Version: 4.0.0

### Features and Enhancements
#### Log query logic optimization

The log query page has been optimized to solve the experience and performance problems users encounter when using the log query function:
   
    - The original radio box has been replaced with the advanced search component. Now you can use the log search as you use the GIT search.
    - Independent query conditions for log content
    - The location of the time query criteria has been adjusted. Now you will not reset your log filter criteria when you adjust the time range.
    - Optimized the log query API to improve the overall query performance
