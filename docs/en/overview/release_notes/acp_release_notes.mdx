# ACP Release Notes

### Features and Enhancements
#### Log query logic optimization

The log query page has been optimized to solve the experience and performance problems users encounter when using the log query function:
   
    - The original radio box has been replaced with the advanced search component. Now you can use the log search as you use the GIT search.
    - Independent query conditions for log content
    - The location of the time query criteria has been adjusted. Now you will not reset your log filter criteria when you adjust the time range.
    - Optimized the log query API to improve the overall query performance

#### ElasticSearch upgrade to 8.17

We upgraded the version of ElasticSearch to 8.17 to follow up the functions and improvements of the community.

#### ALB authentication

ALB now support various authentication mechanism, which allows user to handle authentication at Ingress level instead of implementing it in each backend application. 

#### ALB supports ingress-nginx annotations

This release adds support for common ingress-nginx annotations in ALB, including keepalive settings, timeout configurations, and HTTP redirects, enhancing compatibility with the community ingress-nginx.
