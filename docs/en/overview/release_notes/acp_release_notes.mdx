# Release Notes

## Minor Version: 4.0.0

### Features and Enhancements
#### Log query logic optimization

The log query page has been optimized to solve the experience and performance problems users encounter when using the log query function:
   
    - The original radio box has been replaced with the advanced search component. Now you can use the log search as you use the GIT search.
    - Independent query conditions for log content
    - The location of the time query criteria has been adjusted. Now you will not reset your log filter criteria when you adjust the time range.
    - Optimized the log query API to improve the overall query performance

#### ElasticSearch upgrade to 8.17

We upgraded the version of ElasticSearch to 8.17 to follow up the functions and improvements of the community.

#### ALB authentication

ALB now support various authentication mechanism, which allows user to handle authentication at Ingress level instead of implementing it in each backend application. 

#### ALB supports ingress-nginx annotations

This release adds support for common ingress-nginx annotations in ALB, including keepalive settings, timeout configurations, and HTTP redirects, enhancing compatibility with the community ingress-nginx.

#### Kubevirt live migration optimization

During the live migration process, the network interruption time has been reduced to less than 0.5 seconds, and existing TCP connections will not be disconnected. 
This optimization significantly improves the stability and reliability of virtual machine migrations in production environments.

#### LDAP/OIDC integration optimization

The LDAP/OIDC integration form fields have been adjusted, mainly including removal of unnecessary/duplicate fields and optimization of field descriptions.
LDAP/OIDC integration now supports configuration through YAML, allowing user attribute mapping within the YAML file.
