# Release Notes

## 4.1.0

### Features and Enhancements

#### Logs

- Upgraded ClickHouse to version v25.3.
- Added `POD IP` tags to application logs, allowing filtering by `POD IP`.
- Improved standard output log collection: The timestamp field now reflects the actual print time of the log, instead of the collection component's time, ensuring logs are displayed in the correct order.

#### Monitoring

- Upgraded Prometheus to version v3.5.0.
- Custom variables now support three types: Constant, Custom, and Textbox.
    - **Constant:** A fixed value that does not change.
    - **Custom:** A value selected from a predefined list.
    - **Textbox:** A value entered manually by the user.
- Stat Chart now supports Graph mode, which displays a trend curve for the selected period below the statistic.
- Value Mapping now supports regular expressions and special values.
- Panels can now be copied, allowing you to duplicate a panel within the current dashboard.

#### Tenant Management

- Project quotas now support custom resource quotas and storage class quotas.
- The plugin provides new metrics: `cpaas_project_resourcequota` and `cpaas_project_resourcequota_aggregated`, which can be used to display project quotas in dashboards.
    - `cpaas_project_resourcequota`: Available in every cluster.
    - `cpaas_project_resourcequota_aggregated`: Available in the `global` cluster and aggregates data from all clusters.
- Custom Roles now have additional restrictions, allowing assignment of permissions only within the corresponding role type:
    - **Platform Role:** Can assign all permissions.
    - **Project Role:** Can assign only permissions within the scope of the platform's preset `project-admin-system` role.
    - **Namespace Role:** Can assign only permissions within the scope of the platform's preset `namespace-admin-system` role.
    - Permissions that the current user does not possess cannot be assigned.
