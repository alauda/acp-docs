# Release Notes

## 4.2.0

### Features and Enhancements

#### Support for Kubernetes 1.33

ACP now supports **Kubernetes 1.33**, delivering the latest upstream features, performance improvements, and security enhancements from the Kubernetes community.

#### ACP CLI (ac)

The new **ACP CLI (ac)** enables you to develop, build, deploy, and run applications on ACP with a seamless command-line experience.

Key capabilities include:

* **kubectl-compatible commands**
* **Integrated authentication** with ACP platform environments
* **Unified session management** across multiple environments
* **ACP-specific extensions** for platform access and cross-environment workflows

For full feature details, see:
[ACP CLI (ac)](/ui/cli_tools/ac/index.mdx)

#### Hosted Control Plane (HCP)

**Released:**

* **Alauda Container Platform Kubeadm Provider**
* **Alauda Container Platform Hosted Control Plane**
* **Alauda Container Platform SSH Infrastructure Provider**

**Lifecycle:** *Agnostic* (released asynchronously with ACP)

Hosted Control Plane decouples the control plane from worker nodes by hosting each cluster's control plane as containerized components within a management cluster. This architecture reduces resource usage, speeds up cluster creation and upgrades, and provides improved scalability for large multi-cluster environments.

For more information, see:
[About Hosted Control Plane](/configure/clusters/about-hcp.mdx)

#### Enhanced User Permission Management
We've optimized RBAC management with the following enhancements to improve usability and maintainability:

* **Platform Role Management:**
  * **UI-based permission customization deprecated:** Platform roles no longer support custom permission configuration through the web console. All role permissions must be configured via YAML files.
  * **Backward compatibility maintained:** Existing platform preset roles and roles defined in previous versions remain fully functional. Users can continue to assign these roles to users and grant permissions as before.

* **Kubernetes Role Management:**
  * **Native Kubernetes role management:** A dedicated management interface for Kubernetes Role and ClusterRole resources is now available in the platform console, enabling direct association of Kubernetes roles with users and permission assignment.
  * **Modular permission definitions:** Platform plugin resource permissions will be progressively migrated to independent Role and ClusterRole resources, providing better isolation and easier management.


#### Enhanced Pod Security Policies with Kyverno
We've strengthened workload security capabilities through the Kyverno policy engine:

* Ready-to-Use Security Templates: 8 validated security policy templates built into the console, covering Pod Security Standards levels including Privileged, Baseline, Nonroot, and Restricted
* One-Click Configuration: Quickly create policies from templates in the business view without manual YAML writing, effective immediately in specified namespaces

#### Next-Generation Gateway API powered by Envoy Gateway
This release introduces a new Gateway API implementation based on Envoy Gateway. It provides a unified L7 traffic entry, stays aligned with the community Gateway API specification, and lays the foundation for richer traffic policies and ecosystem integrations.

#### Domain-Based Rules for Egress Firewall
Egress Firewall now supports allow/deny rules based on domain names instead of only IP addresses. This enables fine-grained outbound access control for public SaaS services and external resources whose IP addresses change frequently.

#### New Endpoint Health Checker for Faster Failover
A new Endpoint Health Checker is introduced to detect failures such as node crashes and network partitions more quickly and to remove unhealthy backends in time. This significantly shortens traffic failover duration and reduces the risk of service interruption.

#### New Local Storage Operator for Easier Ceph/TopoLVM Management
The newly introduced **Local Storage** (Alauda Build of Local Storage) Operator greatly simplifies deployment and disk management for Ceph and TopoLVM. During deployment, you can list all available disks across the cluster, including model, capacity, and other key attributes, and select which disks to bring under management.
For disk binding, Ceph and TopoLVM now prefer using device IDs rather than mount paths, preventing storage issues caused by device name changes after node reboot or device re-detection.

### Other Key Changes
#### Lifecycle Change for Logging Plugins

The lifecycle status for logging-related plugins has been changed from *Aligned* to *Agnostic* (released asynchronously with ACP).

**Affected plugins:**

* **Alauda Container Platform Log Essentials** (new in this release)
* **Alauda Container Platform Log Storage for ClickHouse**
* **Alauda Container Platform Log Storage for Elasticsearch**
* **Alauda Container Platform Log Collector**

For more information, see:
[About Logging Service](/observability/log/intro.mdx)

#### Enhanced Default Security Level for Namespaces
Starting from v4.2.0, the default PSA policy for newly created namespaces (via web console or CLI) is changed from Baseline to Restricted.
* Baseline: Prohibits known privilege escalations, provides moderate security
* Restricted: Follows Pod security best practices with strictest requirements

:::warning
The Restricted policy enforces very strict configuration requirements for Pods. If your business requires capabilities such as privileged mode, running as the root user, mounting host paths, or using the host network, these workloads will fail to run in namespaces that default to the Restricted policy.
:::

**Impact Analysis**:
* This change only affects newly created namespaces
* Workloads requiring privileged capabilities (e.g., root user, hostPath mounts) will not run directly

**Recommended Solutions**:
* Modify your application configuration to meet the security requirements of the Restricted policy
* Manually set the namespace policy back to Baseline if necessary

#### MinIO in Maintenance Mode
The **MinIO** (Alauda Build of MinIO) has entered **maintenance mode**. Only security fixes will be provided in the future, and no new features are planned. Existing MinIO clusters can continue to run, while new object storage requirements should prefer Ceph Object as the recommended solution.

#### Calico in Maintenance Mode
The **Calico** (Alauda Container Platform Networking for Calico) CNI plugin has entered **maintenance mode**. We will only address security-related issues, and it is no longer the default recommended network option. Existing Calico clusters remain supported, while new clusters should use kube-ovn as the standard CNI.

#### Ingress Nginx Switched to Operator
The **Ingress Nginx** (Alauda Build of Ingress Nginx) has been migrated from a cluster plug-in to an Operator-based deployment and management model. Existing Ingress resources will continue to work after the upgrade, and subsequent operations are expected to be carried out through the Operator. Although the upstream community version of Ingress Nginx is no longer updated, we will continue to provide bug fixes and security patches for this distribution.

### Deprecated and Removed Features

#### Kubernetes Version Upgrade Policy Update

Starting from **ACP 4.2**, upgrading the Kubernetes version is **no longer optional**. When performing a cluster upgrade, the Kubernetes version must be upgraded together with other platform components.
This change ensures version consistency across the cluster and reduces future maintenance windows.

#### ALB Deprecated Starting from v4.2.0
The **ALB** (Alauda Container Platform Ingress Gateway) is marked as deprecated as of v4.2.0. New clusters and new users should adopt the Envoy Gateway–based Gateway API as the primary option. Existing clusters using ALB will keep working after the upgrade, but we strongly recommend planning and executing a migration to the Gateway API for long-term support and feature evolution.

#### Flannel Fully Removed
The **Flannel** (Alauda Container Platform Networking for Flannel) CNI plugin has been completely removed from the platform. Clusters still using Flannel must migrate to kube-ovn before upgrading to this release or any later version. Please plan and complete the migration in advance to avoid service disruption caused by switching the CNI.
