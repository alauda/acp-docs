# Release Notes

## 4.2.0

### Features and Enhancements

#### Support for Kubernetes 1.33

ACP now supports **Kubernetes 1.33**, delivering the latest upstream features, performance improvements, and security enhancements from the Kubernetes community.

#### ACP CLI (ac)

The new **ACP CLI (ac)** enables you to develop, build, deploy, and run applications on ACP with a seamless command-line experience.

Key capabilities include:

* **kubectl-compatible commands**
* **Integrated authentication** with ACP platform environments
* **Unified session management** across multiple environments
* **ACP-specific extensions** for platform access and cross-environment workflows

For full feature details, see:
[ACP CLI (ac)](/ui/cli_tools/ac/index.mdx)

#### Hosted Control Plane (HCP)

**Released:**

* **Alauda Container Platform Kubeadm Provider**
* **Alauda Container Platform Hosted Control Plane**
* **Alauda Container Platform SSH Infrastructure Provider**

**Lifecycle:** *Agnostic* (released asynchronously with ACP)

Hosted Control Plane decouples the control plane from worker nodes by hosting each cluster's control plane as containerized components within a management cluster. This architecture reduces resource usage, speeds up cluster creation and upgrades, and provides improved scalability for large multi-cluster environments.
