### Features and Enhancements

#### Installation and Upgrade: Modular Architecture

We've completely redesigned our platform's architecture to provide unprecedented flexibility, faster updates, and reduced operational overhead.

**Streamlined Installation**
Our platform is now deployed via a lean core package containing only the essential components. Once the foundation is in place, customers can pick and choose exactly which Operators or cluster plugins they need—whether DevOps, Service Mesh, or other specialized features—and download, upload, and install them individually.

**Targeted Patches**

* Patch releases include only those components that actually require bug fixes.
* Components without fixes remain exactly as they are, ensuring the rest of the platform stays untouched.
* Customers apply patches through the platform’s built-in, standardized upgrade mechanism—rather than manually updating individual components—making maintenance and tracking far more straightforward.

**Intelligent Upgrades**

* During an upgrade, only components with new code are replaced and restarted.
* Unmodified components retain their existing versions and uptime.
* This minimizes downtime and shortens the maintenance window for a smoother upgrade experience.

**Independent Component Versioning**

* Most Operators follow their own release schedules, separate from the core platform.
* New features and fixes go live as soon as they’re ready—no need to wait for a full-platform update.
* This approach accelerates delivery and lets customers benefit from improvements faster.

#### Clusters: Declarative Cluster Lifecycle Management with Cluster API

On-premises clusters now leverage the Kubernetes Cluster API for fully declarative operations, including:
- Cluster creation
- Node scaling and joining

This seamless Cluster API integration fits directly into your IaC pipelines, enabling end-to-end, programmatic control over your cluster lifecycle.

#### Operator & Extension: Comprehensive Capability Visibility

**Complete Operator Catalog**

The OperatorHub now displays all supported Operators regardless of whether their packages have been uploaded to the platform. This enhancement:
- Provides full visibility into platform capabilities even in air-gapped environments
- Eliminates information gaps between what's available and what's known to users
- Reduces discovery friction when exploring platform capabilities

**Version Flexibility**

Users can now select specific Operator versions during installation rather than being limited to only the latest version, providing greater control over component compatibility and upgrade paths.

**Web Console Extensions**

Operators now support anchor-based Web Console extensions, allowing functionality-specific frontend images to be included within Operators and seamlessly integrated into the platform's Web Console.

**Cluster Plugin Enhancements**

All improvements to Operator visibility, version selection, and Web Console extension capabilities also apply to cluster plugins, ensuring consistent user experience across all platform extensions.

#### Log query logic optimization

The log query page has been optimized to solve the experience and performance problems users encounter when using the log query function:

    - The original radio box has been replaced with the advanced search component. Now you can use the log search as you use the GIT search.
    - Independent query conditions for log content
    - The location of the time query criteria has been adjusted. Now you will not reset your log filter criteria when you adjust the time range.
    - Optimized the log query API to improve the overall query performance

#### ElasticSearch upgrade to 8.17

We upgraded the version of ElasticSearch to 8.17 to follow up the functions and improvements of the community.

#### ALB authentication

ALB now support various authentication mechanism, which allows user to handle authentication at Ingress level instead of implementing it in each backend application.

#### ALB supports ingress-nginx annotations

This release adds support for common ingress-nginx annotations in ALB, including keepalive settings, timeout configurations, and HTTP redirects, enhancing compatibility with the community ingress-nginx.

#### Kubevirt live migration optimization

During the live migration process, the network interruption time has been reduced to less than 0.5 seconds, and existing TCP connections will not be disconnected.
This optimization significantly improves the stability and reliability of virtual machine migrations in production environments.

#### LDAP/OIDC integration optimization

The LDAP/OIDC integration form fields have been adjusted, mainly including removal of unnecessary/duplicate fields and optimization of field descriptions.
LDAP/OIDC integration now supports configuration through YAML, allowing user attribute mapping within the YAML file.

#### Source to Image (S2I) Support
    - Added **Alauda Container Platform Builds** operator for automated image building from source code
    - Supports Java/Go/Node.js/Python language stacks
    - Streamlines application deployment via source code repositories

#### On-prem Registry Solution
    - **ACP Registry** delivered lightweight Docker Registry with enterprise-ready features
    - Provides out-of-the-box image management capabilities
    - Simplifies application delivery

####  GitOps Module Refactoring
    - Decoupled **ACP GitOps** into standalone cluster plugin architecture
    - Upgraded Argo CD to v2.14.x version
    - Enhanced GitOps-based application lifecycle management

#### Namespace-level Monitoring
    - Introduced dynamic monitoring dashboards at namespace level
    - Provides Applications/Workloads/Pods metrics visualization

#### Crossplane Integration
    - Released **Alauda Build of Crossplane** distribution
    - Implements app-centric provisioning via XRD compositions

#### Virtualization Updates
    - Upgraded to KubeVirt 1.4 for enhanced virtualization capabilities
    - Optimized image handling for faster VM provisioning
    - Optimized VM live migration, now initiable directly from the UI with visible migration status
    - Improved binding networking with dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6) support
    - Added vTPM support to enhance VM security

#### Ceph Storage Updates
    - Metro-DR with stretch cluster enables real-time data synchronization across availability zones
    - Regional-DR with pool-based mirroring enhances data protection

#### TopoLVM Updates
    - Added support for multipath device deployment, improving flexibility and stability
