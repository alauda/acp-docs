# Architecture

## Functional Perspective

<Term name="product" /> (<Term name="productShort" />)'s complete functionality consists of **<Term name="productShort" /> Core** and extensions based on two technical stacks: **Operator** and **Cluster Plugin**.

* **<Term name="productShort" /> Core**

  The minimal deliverable unit of <Term name="productShort" />, providing core capabilities such as cluster management, container orchestration, projects, and user administration.

  * Meets the highest security standards
  * Delivers maximum stability
  * Offers the longest support lifecycle

* **Extensions**

  Extensions in both the Operator and Cluster Plugin stacks can be classified into:

  * **Aligned** – Life cycle strategy consisting of multiple maintenance streams, with alignment to <Term name="productShort" />.
  * **Agnostic** – Life cycle strategy consisting of multiple maintenance streams, released independently from <Term name="productShort" />.

  For more details about extensions, see [Extend](../extend/index.mdx).

## Deployment Perspective

<Term name="productShort" /> is composed of a **`global` cluster** and one or more **workload clusters**.

* **`global` Cluster**

  * The central hub for multi-cluster management
  * All clusters must be registered to `global` before they can be managed
  * Hosts multi-cluster and cross-cluster functionality
  * Kubernetes is deployed and managed by the platform

* **Workload Cluster**

  * Hosts user workloads and services
  * Kubernetes may be deployed by the platform or provided by third parties
  * Supports Kubernetes services from major cloud providers as well as CNCF-compliant Kubernetes clusters
  * In certain scenarios, the `global` cluster may also host business workloads

## Technical Perspective

**Platform Component Runtime**
All platform components run as containers within a Kubernetes management cluster (the `global` cluster).

**High Availability Architecture**


* The `global` cluster typically consists of at least three control plane nodes and multiple worker nodes
* High availability of etcd is central to cluster HA; see *Key Component High Availability Mechanisms* for details
* Load balancing can be provided by an external load balancer or a self-built VIP inside the cluster

**Request Routing**

* Client requests first pass through the load balancer or self-built VIP
* Requests are forwarded to **ALB** (the platform's default Kubernetes Ingress Gateway) running on designated ingress nodes (or control-plane nodes if configured)
* ALB routes traffic to the target component pods according to configured rules

**Replica Strategy**

* Core components run with at least two replicas
* Key components (such as registry, MinIO, ALB) run with three replicas

**Fault Tolerance & Self-healing**

* Achieved through cooperation between kubelet, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, kube-proxy, ALB, and other components
* Includes health checks, failover, and traffic redirection

**Data Storage & Recovery**

* Control-plane configuration and platform state are stored in etcd as Kubernetes resources
* In catastrophic failures, recovery can be performed from etcd snapshots

**Primary / Standby Disaster Recovery**

* Two separate `global` clusters: **Primary Cluster** and **Standby Cluster**
* The disaster recovery mechanism is based on real-time synchronization of etcd data from the Primary Cluster to the Standby Cluster.
* If the Primary Cluster becomes unavailable due to a failure, services can quickly switch to the Standby Cluster.

### Key Component High Availability Mechanisms

**etcd**

* Deployed on three (or five) control plane nodes
* Uses the RAFT protocol for leader election and data replication
* Three-node deployments tolerate up to one node failure; five-node deployments tolerate up to two
* Supports local and remote S3 snapshot backups

**Monitoring Components**

* **Prometheus**: Multiple instances, deduplication with Thanos Query, and cross-region redundancy
* **VictoriaMetrics**: Cluster mode with distributed VMStorage, VMInsert, and VMSelect components

**Logging Components**

* **Nevermore** collects logs and audit data
* **Kafka / Elasticsearch / Razor / Lanaya** are deployed in distributed and multi-replica modes

**Networking Components (CNI)**

* **Kube-OVN / Calico / Flannel**: Achieve HA via stateless DaemonSets or triple-replica control plane components

**ALB**

* Operator deployed with three replicas, leader election enabled
* Instance-level health checks and load balancing

**Self-built VIP**

* High-availability virtual IP based on Keepalived
* Supports heartbeat detection and active-standby failover

**Harbor**

* ALB-based load balancing
* PostgreSQL with Patroni HA
* Redis Sentinel mode
* Stateless services deployed in multiple replicas

**Registry and MinIO**

* Registry deployed with three replicas
* MinIO in distributed mode with erasure coding, data redundancy, and automatic recovery
