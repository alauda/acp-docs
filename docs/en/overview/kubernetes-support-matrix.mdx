# Kubernetes Support Matrix

This document provides the Kubernetes version support matrix for <Term name="productShort" />. This information is critical when creating clusters, upgrading <Term name="productShort" />, and managing third-party clusters.

## Overview

<Term name="productShort" /> supports multiple Kubernetes versions across different <Term name="productShort" /> releases. Understanding the supported versions is essential for:

- **Creating clusters** – Determine which Kubernetes versions can be used when provisioning new clusters
- **Upgrading <Term name="productShort" />** – Ensure all workload clusters meet compatibility requirements before upgrading the global cluster
- **Managing third-party clusters** – Verify that public cloud or CNCF-compliant Kubernetes clusters are within the supported version range

## Version Support Matrix

The following table shows the Kubernetes version support for each <Term name="productShort" /> release.

:::info
The table lists <Term name="productShort" /> minor versions and does not distinguish between patch versions. Patch versions only include bug fixes and security updates, so the Kubernetes minor versions remain consistent across all patch versions within the same minor release.

**Starting from <Term name="productShort" /> 4.1**, each <Term name="productShort" /> release supports only **one Kubernetes version** for cluster creation.
This ensures consistency and simplifies the upgrade path for new clusters.
:::

| <Term name="productShort" /> Version | Supported for Cluster Creation | Compatible Versions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <Term name="productShort" /> 4.2 | 1.33 | 1.33, 1.32, 1.31, 1.30 |
| <Term name="productShort" /> 4.1 | 1.32 | 1.32, 1.31, 1.30, 1.29 |
| <Term name="productShort" /> 4.0 | 1.31, 1.30, 1.29, 1.28 | 1.31, 1.30, 1.29, 1.28 |

## Upgrade Requirements

For <Term name="productShort" /> 4.2 and earlier, **all** workload clusters must be upgraded to the **latest** Kubernetes version in the compatible versions list **before** upgrading the <Term name="productShort" /> global cluster.

In future releases, workload clusters will only need to be within the compatible versions range to upgrade the <Term name="productShort" /> global cluster.
