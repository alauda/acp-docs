1. What is an introduction

The "introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or feature modules, providing an overall description of the product or function. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and intended uses, offering readers a clear initial understanding.

We generally determine whether to include the introduction, benefits, and function overview in the same document based on the overall length of the articles. For complex products (such as platform products containing multiple core modules), it is recommended to split these contents into independent documents; for single feature modules, they can be combined into one document.

2. The importance of the introduction

There may be many points involved in the product or feature modules, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified understanding: Providing a consistent understanding as an opening can reduce communication errors.
- Guide reading: Providing readers with clear product background facilitates a deeper understanding of the subsequent detailed content.
- Improve efficiency: Reducing the time spent on repetitive explanations regarding basic product knowledge.

3. How to think about the introduction section

- Concise and clear: Summarize the core points of the product using straightforward language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight key points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functionalities of the product.
- Reader-oriented: Consider the background of the target audience and provide the information they care about.

4. The special nature of the introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documents. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the value of product functionalities, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product features.

There are some differences between product-level and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the productâ€™s position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functionalities included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive and need to be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of individual modules.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the individual module.
