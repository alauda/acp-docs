# Deployment

This article will introduce how to deploy the components that the cost management feature relies on in the platform.

## Deploying the Alauda Cost Manager Plugin

1. In the left navigation bar, click **App Store Management** > **Cluster Plugins**.

2. Select the global cluster.

3. Click the action button to the right of the Alauda Cost Manager plugin > **Deploy**.

## Deploying the Alauda Kubecost Plugin

### Prerequisites

- The deployment and usage of the Alauda Kubecost plugin rely on the Prometheus plugin. Please first **deploy the Prometheus plugin**.

- Please **create a storage class** as needed before deploying the Alauda Kubecost plugin.

### Steps

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Cluster Management** > **Clusters**.

2. In the cluster list, click the ***cluster name*** where you need to deploy the Alauda Kubecost plugin.

3. Under the **Plugins** tab, click **Alauda Kubecost** to the right > **Deploy**.

4. Refer to the following description to configure the relevant parameters.

   | Parameter               | Description                                                                                                                   |
   | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Kubecost Secret Name** | Kubecost needs to access the Kubernetes cluster to obtain cost and resource usage data. For secure authentication, you need to create or select a Secret containing the credentials required to access Kubecost, ensuring secure access to Kubecost. |
   | **Storage Class**        | Select an appropriate storage class to store data in Kubecost. Kubecost needs to store data on cost analysis, resource usage, etc. The storage class defines how this data is stored in the Kubernetes cluster.                                      |
   | **Storage Size**         | Kubecost will store a large amount of data, so you need to choose a suitable storage size that can accommodate all the data based on the cluster size and data storage needs (in Gi, e.g., 8 Gi).                                              |

5. Click **Deploy**.
