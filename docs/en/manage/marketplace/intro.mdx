1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and expected uses, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

Generally, we decide whether to include the Introduction, Advantages, and Feature Overview sections in one document based on the overall length of the articles. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to break these contents into separate documents; for single feature modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. The Importance of Introduction

There may be many points involved in a product or feature module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Serve as an opening to provide a consistent understanding and reduce communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Provide readers with a clear product background, making it easy to delve into subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repeatedly explaining basic product concepts.

3. How to Conceptualize this Introduction Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product in simple language, avoiding lengthy explanations.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main functionalities.
- Reader-Centric: Consider the background of the target readers and provide information that matters to them.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expressions, it helps the team better convey the product's functional value, allowing users to quickly understand and utilize product features.

We will notice some differences between the product-level introduction and the module-level introduction:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introduction

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the productâ€™s position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be broader, needing to be described in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introduction

- **Module Positioning**: Describe the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the features and advantages of the single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.
