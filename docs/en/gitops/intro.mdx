# Introduction

GitOps is a practice of continuous delivery and operations based on Git, which utilizes the Git repository as a "Single Source of Truth" (SSOT) to define and manage infrastructure, application configurations, and deployment processes. By uniformly storing application code, configuration files, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) definitions in a Git repository, GitOps achieves version control and automated management of the entire software delivery lifecycle. In the GitOps model, developers and operations personnel can collaborate on software development, testing, and deployment using Git's branching, code review, and merge request features. When code or configurations change and are pushed to the Git repository, automated tools detect these changes and trigger a sequence of automated processes such as building, testing, and deployment, thereby enabling continuous delivery and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of software.

## GitOps Use Cases

- **Continuous Delivery of Containerized Applications**: In a Kubernetes environment, GitOps can manage the deployment, updates, and rollbacks of containerized applications. Developers submit application code and Kubernetes configuration files to the Git repository, and GitOps tools automatically deploy the applications to the Kubernetes cluster, updating them according to configuration file changes.

- **Multi-Environment Management**: GitOps can manage infrastructure and application configurations across multiple environments, such as development, testing, pre-production, and production. Through branching strategies and environment tags, it ensures that configurations are consistent across different environments while allowing for customized configurations as needed.

- **Operations of Microservices Architecture**: In a microservices architecture, GitOps can help teams efficiently manage the deployment and updates of numerous microservices. The code and configurations for each microservice can be stored independently in the Git repository, and GitOps tools will automatically deploy and update according to the microservices' dependencies and update strategies, ensuring the stable operation of the system.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Management**: GitOps can be integrated with IaC tools such as Terraform and Ansible to manage cloud infrastructure, server configurations, and network resources. By storing IaC configuration files in a Git repository, it enables version control and automated deployment of infrastructure, improving manageability and repeatability of infrastructure.

- **Cross-Team Collaboration and Code Sharing**: In large organizations, multiple teams may need to share code and configurations. GitOps provides a unified platform for teams to share code, collaborate on development, and manage configurations through the Git repository, enhancing collaboration efficiency and code reuse among teams.
