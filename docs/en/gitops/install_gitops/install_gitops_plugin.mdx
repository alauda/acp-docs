# Deploying GitOps Cluster Plugin

## Prerequisites

1. Download the Alauda GitOps cluster plugin installation package that matches your platform.
2. Deploy the GitOps cluster plugin to the `global` cluster using the platform's application publication capability.

:::info
Cluster plugin package publication process: Go to **Platform Management -> Application Store Management -> Application Publication** page, then click **Help Document** on the right to get instructions on how to publish the cluster plugin to `global` cluster. For more details, please refer to [Application Publication](https://docs.alauda.cn/docs/platform/gitops/gitops-plugin-install/gitops-plugin-install-guide.html).

## Deploying GitOps Plugin

### Constraints and Limitations

- Only supports deployment in the global cluster.
- After deploying the GitOps plugin, the ArgoCD instance in the argocd-operator will be restricted from operations.

### Operation Steps

1. Log in to the platform and go to the **Platform Management** page.
2. In the left navigation bar, select **Application Store Management** -> **Cluster Plugins** to enter the **Cluster Plugins** list page.
3. Find the **GitOps** plugin, click **Deploy**, and navigate to the **Deploy GitOps Plugin** page.
4. It is recommended to use the suggested default configuration; simply click **Deploy** to complete the GitOps plugin deployment.
5. On the **Install Cluster Plugin** page, select **Default Configuration** and click **Deploy**.

The parameter descriptions are as follows:

| **Parameter**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Argo CD Native UI** | Select whether to access the native web UI provided by Argo CD as needed. This interface includes features like monitoring, repository management, and role control, and can be used to manage and monitor the deployed applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Single Sign-On**          | **Single Sign-On (SSO)** is an authentication and authorization mechanism that allows users to log in once with a set of credentials (such as a username and password) to gain access to multiple systems or applications without repeatedly authenticating. <br /> It is recommended to **enable** SSO, which allows for quick access to the Argo CD native UI using platform account information, enhancing the login experience while also improving security and convenience. <br /> **Note**: The SSO feature requires the Argo CD native UI feature to be enabled. <ul><li> Only supports access to the platform using HTTPS protocol; if the platform is accessed using HTTP protocol, SSO functionality will not work even if enabled.</li><li> After enabling SSO and using the access address to open the Argo CD login interface, click the **LOG IN VIA OIDC** button in the interface for one-click login to the Argo CD native UI.</li></ul> |
| **Access Address**          | Recommended: This is the address to access the Argo CD native UI, dynamically generated based on the platform address, no need to fill in manually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Account**            | The account used to log in and access the Argo CD native UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Password**            | After enabling access to the Argo CD native UI, you can execute the following command in the global cluster's CLI tool to obtain it. <br />[Get Argo CD admin account password](../how_to/argocd_info.mdx#argocd-password-cli)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Resource Quota**          | The minimum requirements and recommendations for the platform are as follows: <ul><li> **Minimum**: CPU requests must not be less than 100 m, and memory requests must not be less than 250 Mi, and request values must not exceed limit values.</li><li> **Recommended**: CPU requests should not be less than 250 m, and memory requests should not be less than 500 Mi; CPU limit values should not be less than 2 cores, and memory limit values should not be less than 2 Gi.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Deployment Verification

1. Access the **Platform Management** page; under the cluster management left navigation, the **Cluster Configuration Management** entry will be displayed, and the capabilities of **Cluster Configuration Management** can be used.
2. Access **Container Platform**; the left navigation will display **GitOps Applications** entry, where you can **Create GitOps Application** to immediately experience [Creating a SpringBoot Argo CD Application](../how_to/deploy_gitops_app.mdx).
