# About Alauda Container Platform GitOps

Alauda Container Platform GitOps is a Kubernetes-native GitOps solution built on Argo CD. It monitors configuration manifests (applications, infrastructure definitions, etc.) in Git repositories and automatically synchronizes them to target Kubernetes clusters, implementing Git-driven continuous delivery. By codifying the entire delivery pipeline in Git's version control system, it enhances deployment velocity, reliability, and security while enabling precise multi-cluster application distribution.
