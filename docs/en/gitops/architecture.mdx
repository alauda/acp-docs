# Architecture

## GitOps and Argo CD

GitOps is a theory, while Argo CD is a tool that implements GitOps. Argo CD achieves a Git-based continuous delivery process by monitoring the configuration files in a Git repository and automatically synchronizing them to the target environment, improving the speed, reliability, and security of software delivery by incorporating the entire delivery process into the Git version control system.

**Alauda GitOps** is based on Argo CD, using the Git repository as the sole trusted source to store application, infrastructure configuration, and other files for rapid and accurate distribution and deployment to one or multiple Kubernetes clusters.

## Typical GitOps Architecture

The main difference between GitOps and traditional application management methods is:

- It doesn't directly manipulate the runtime environment but controls it by maintaining an application configuration repository on Git.
- Argo CD corrects the discrepancies between the runtime environment and the application configuration repository in a timely manner through continuous pull, ensuring that it meets expectations, preventing configuration drift, securing stable operation of business applications, and enabling rapid recovery in the event of failure.

## Alauda Container Platform (ACP) GitOps Architecture

Alauda GitOps is deployed as a cluster plugin on the ACP Global cluster and utilizes Argo CD for application distribution and infrastructure provisioning across multiple business clusters.
