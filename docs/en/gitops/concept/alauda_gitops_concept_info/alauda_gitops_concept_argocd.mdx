# Introduction to Alauda GitOps

Alauda Container Platform (ACP) GitOps (referred to as Alauda GitOps) is implemented based on Argo CD. By monitoring configuration files (such as applications, infrastructure configurations, etc.) in a Git repository, Argo CD automatically synchronizes them to the target environment, achieving a Git-based continuous delivery process. By incorporating the entire delivery process into the Git version control system, it enhances the speed, reliability, and security of software delivery, enabling rapid and precise application distribution and deployment to one or more Kubernetes clusters. 
Additionally, Alauda GitOps provides native support for the Argo CD Operator, which allows for the automation of deployment, upgrades, rollbacks, and other operations through the Argo CD Operator.

## Why Choose Argo CD

Argo CD is a highly popular open-source GitOps tool that offers the following significant advantages:

- Versatile Functionality: Argo CD provides a wealth of features, including declarative deployment, automated synchronization, version control, rollback, monitoring, security, and more. It can meet a variety of complex deployment scenarios.
- User-Friendly: Argo CD offers a friendly web UI and command-line tools, making it easy for users to manage application deployments. Its configuration is also straightforward and easy to get started with.
- Kubernetes Integration: Argo CD integrates closely with Kubernetes and can effectively leverage Kubernetes features such as Deployment, Service, Ingress, etc.
- Multi-Cluster Support: Argo CD supports multi-cluster management, allowing applications to be conveniently deployed across different Kubernetes clusters.
- Plugin Ecosystem: Argo CD has a rich plugin ecosystem that can integrate with other tools such as Helm, Kustomize, and Istio.
- Active Community: Argo CD boasts an active community, where users can receive timely support and assistance.

## Advantages of Alauda GitOps <a id="alauda-gitops-advantage" />

> In addition to the advantages of GitOps, Alauda GitOps has the following benefits:

- **Complete Capabilities of Native Argo CD Operator**

  - Provides the complete functional capabilities of the native Argo CD Operator, including deployment, upgrades, rollbacks, and the complete feature set of Argo CD.

- **Argo CD Operator's Safety Net Service**

  - Technical support for the Argo CD Operator, covering issues such as fault response and security problem remediation.

- **Visual GitOps Application Multi-Environment Distribution Management**

  Combines the platform's multi-cluster management and differentiated configuration capabilities to achieve visual GitOps application management and cluster configuration management that align with the platform's style, making precise distribution across multi-cloud and multi-environment simpler and easier to use.

- **Visual GitOps Application Operations and Maintenance**

  Provides quick access to real-time logs and events of Kubernetes Workload resources under GitOps applications. When an anomaly occurs in a GitOps application, users can quickly analyze and resolve the issue using Argo CD's anomaly information and real-time logs of Workloads without needing to navigate away from the page.

- **Visual GitOps Cluster Configuration Management**

  Manages cluster configurations through GitOps, achieving unified management and distribution of cluster configurations.

- **Closed Loop GitOps Application Management in Integration with All Products on the Platform**

  - Integrates the continuous building, artifact management, and microservice gray release capabilities provided by the platform's DevOps to realize fully automated GitOps application management, forming a complete closed loop of continuous integration and continuous delivery collaboration.
  - Combines products such as CrossPlane, MySQL, and Developer Portal provided by the platform to achieve a complete process from infrastructure initialization and business application initialization (code, pipeline, GitOps application initialization, etc.) to application code development and deployment.
