# Introduction

ACP GitOps is a Kubernetes-native GitOps solution built on Argo CD. It monitors configuration manifests (applications, infrastructure definitions, etc.) in Git repositories and automatically synchronizes them to target Kubernetes clusters, implementing Git-driven continuous delivery. By codifying the entire delivery pipeline in Git's version control system, it enhances deployment velocity, reliability, and security while enabling precise multi-cluster application distribution.

The solution natively integrates the Argo CD Operator to automate deployment lifecycle operations including provisioning, upgrades, and rollbacks.

## Why Argo CD?

Argo CD stands as the industry-leading open-source GitOps engine due to its distinctive advantages:

| **Technical Advantages** | **Operational Benefits** |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------|
| **Declarative GitOps Engine** <br/> - State reconciliation via CRDs (Application, ApplicationSet) <br/> - Multi-source support (Helm, Kustomize, raw YAML) | **Accelerated Deployment** <br/> - 70% faster deployment cycles through Git-driven automation |
| **Kubernetes-Native Architecture** <br/> - Deep integration with Kubernetes API server <br/> - Native support for Namespace isolation and RBAC | **Enterprise Readiness** <br/> - Built-in multi-tenancy and audit capabilities |
| **Multi-Cluster Management** <br/> - Centralized control plane for hybrid/multi-cloud deployments <br/> - Cluster-specific configuration through ApplicationSets | **Operational Efficiency** <br/> - 60% reduction in deployment errors through declarative enforcement |
| **Extensible Plugin System** <br/> - Certified integrations with Helm, Kustomize, Istio <br/> - Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for advanced workflows | **Cost Optimization** <br/> - 40% lower cloud costs through precise resource orchestration |
| **Active CNCF Ecosystem** <br/> - 3,500+ GitHub stars <br/> - 200+ active contributors | **Future-Proof** <br/> - Continuous innovation through open-source community |


## Advantages <a id="alauda-gitops-advantage" />

> In addition to the inherent advantages of GitOps, ACP GitOps offers the following enhanced benefits:

- **Enterprise-Grade Argo CD Operator**

  - Delivers the full suite of functionalities from the native Argo CD Operator, covering application deployment, upgrades, rollbacks, and all core features of Argo CD.

- **Argo CD Operator Safety Service**

  - Offers dedicated technical support for the Argo CD Operator, addressing fault responses, security vulnerability patches, and overall system stability.

- **Visual GitOps Application Multi-Environment Distribution Management**

  - Leverages the platform's multi-cluster management and differentiated configuration capabilities to achieve style-consistent, visual GitOps application management and cluster configuration management, simplifying precise distribution across multi-cloud and multi-environment setups.

- **Visual GitOps Application Operations and Maintenance**

  - Grants direct access to real-time logs and events of Kubernetes Workload resources under GitOps applications. During GitOps application anomalies, users can swiftly analyze and resolve issues using Argo CD's anomaly information and real-time Workload logs without leaving the current interface.

- **Visual GitOps Cluster Configuration Management**

  - Manages cluster configurations through GitOps, achieving unified management and distribution of cluster configurations in a visual manner.

- **Closed-Loop GitOps Application Management Integrated with All Platform Products**

  - Integrates the platform's DevOps capabilities for continuous building, artifact management, and microservice gray release to realize fully automated GitOps application management, forming a complete closed loop of continuous integration and continuous delivery collaboration.
  - Combines with platform products like CrossPlane, MySQL, and Developer Portal to achieve a comprehensive process spanning infrastructure initialization, business application initialization (including code, pipeline, GitOps application initialization, etc.), and application code development and deployment.
