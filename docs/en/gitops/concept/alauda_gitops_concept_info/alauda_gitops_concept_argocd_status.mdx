# ACP GitOps Sync and Health Status

Alauda Container Platform (ACP) GitOps (referred to as Alauda GitOps) encapsulates the state of Application type applications based on the status of Kubernetes resources; the state of the Application type applications determines the state of the ApplicationSet type applications.

## Sync Status

Resources and applications have four sync statuses: **Sync Failed**, **Pending Sync**, **Syncing**, and **Synchronized**.

| **Sync Status**  | **Description**                                 |
| :------ | :------------------------------------ |
| **Sync Failed**  | May be due to network issues or other reasons that caused the resource sync to fail; the failure reason can be checked. |
| **Pending Sync** | The current state of resources in the cluster is inconsistent with the desired state in the repository; syncing is needed. |
| **Syncing**      | The current state of resources in the cluster is inconsistent with the desired state in the repository; syncing is in progress. |
| **Synchronized** | The current state of resources in the cluster is consistent with the desired state in the repository. |

:::info
**Sync Status Display Priority**: **Sync Failed** > **Pending Sync** > **Syncing** > **Synchronized**, as illustrated below:

- Among the Application type applications created through the GitOps application, there are two Kubernetes resources with sync statuses of **Syncing** and **Synchronized**, respectively. According to the display priority, it can be seen that the display priority of **Syncing** is higher than that of **Synchronized**, therefore the sync status of this Application type application is **Syncing**.
- For the ApplicationSet type applications created through the GitOps application, with configurations distributed to two different namespaces, two Application type applications with the same source will be automatically created. The sync statuses of these two applications are **Sync Failed** and **Synchronized** respectively. Based on the display priority, it can be concluded that the display priority of **Sync Failed** is higher than that of **Synchronized**, thus the sync status of this ApplicationSet type application is **Sync Failed**.

## Health Status

Resources and applications have six health statuses: **Unknown**, **Missing**, **Degraded**, **Paused**, **Processing**, and **Healthy**.

| **Health Status** | **Description**                                                                                                          | **Reference Solution**                                                                                                   |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unknown**   | Unable to determine the current health status of the resource, likely due to an abnormal occurrence.            | Switch to the corresponding YAML file of the resource, check the abnormal information in the status.condition field, and analyze the problem using the abnormal information and real-time logs of the Workload. |
| **Missing**   | The resource has not been created.                                                                         | **Scenario 1**: When creating the resource for the first time, it may take a while for the status to change from missing to healthy. If the sync status is Sync Failed during this period, check whether the repository configuration is correct.<br /> **Scenario 2**: If the resource is missing due to deletion in the target environment, manually sync the related resources. |
| **Degraded**   | For Workload resources, indicates that the Pods of the Workload have not transitioned from **Processing** to **Healthy** states within a given time frame, which defaults to 10 minutes. | Check real-time logs of the Pods and analyze events to identify solutions.                                                                  |
| **Paused**   | For Workload resources, indicates that the rolling update has been paused.                                    | Check real-time logs of the Workload and analyze events to identify solutions.                                                            |
| **Processing** | The resource has been successfully created, but the Pods have not yet reached the Ready state, and are expected to achieve a healthy status soon. | -                                                                                                             |
| **Healthy**   | The resource is functioning properly and is in a healthy state.                                                  | -                                                                                                             |

The health status display priority is: Unknown > Missing > Degraded > Paused > Processing > Healthy, as illustrated below:

- Among the Application type applications created through the GitOps application, there are two Kubernetes resources with health statuses of **Healthy** and **Unknown** respectively. According to the display priority, it can be seen that the display priority of **Unknown** is higher than that of **Healthy**, thus the health status of this Application type application is **Unknown**.
- For the ApplicationSet type applications created through the GitOps application, with configurations distributed to two different namespaces, two Application type applications with the same source will be automatically created. The health statuses of these two applications are **Missing** and **Processing** respectively. Based on the display priority, it can be inferred that the display priority of **Missing** is higher than that of **Processing**, therefore the health status of this ApplicationSet type application is **Missing**.

## Recognition Rules

Kubernetes resources achieve the following statuses to be displayed as healthy states. The specific recognition rules are as follows:

| **Resource Type**               | **Status**                                      |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| **Deployment**           | The deployment has completed the rolling update and all instances are in a healthy state. |
| **StatefulSet**          | The StatefulSet has completed the update, and all instances are in a healthy state.        |
| **ReplicaSet**           | All Pods of the ReplicaSet are in a healthy state.                |
| **DaemonSet**            | The number of Pod instances in the DaemonSet has reached the desired count, and all Pod instances are in a healthy state. |
| **Ingress**              | The status of the Ingress contains non-empty LoadBalancer information.  |
| **Service**              | The status of the Service contains non-empty LoadBalancer information.  |
| **PVC**                  | The Persistent Volume Claim status is bound.                       |
| **Pod**                  | All containers in the Pod are in a healthy state.                  |
| **Job**                  | The Job has completed successfully.                               |
| **HPA**                  | The HPA has completed scaling successfully.                   |
