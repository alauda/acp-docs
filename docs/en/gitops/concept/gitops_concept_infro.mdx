# In-Depth Understanding of GitOps

## Definition of GitOps

GitOps refers to the practice of using a Git repository as the central point for infrastructure and application configuration, where all operations are version-controlled, automated, and auditable through Git. It primarily relies on declarative configuration files by storing the definitions of infrastructure and application deployments in a Git repository; any changes to these configurations must be committed via Git and trigger automated processes for deployment.

## Principles of GitOps

- **Declarative**: The declarative nature is the fundamental basis for implementing GitOps. In GitOps, all tools must be declarative, using Git as the single source of truth, allowing applications to be easily deployed to Kubernetes clusters. In the event of platform-level failures, applications can also be deployed to other standard platforms at any time.
- **Versioned and Immutable**: Based on the declarative approach, the versions of infrastructure and applications can be mapped to the corresponding versions in Git source code. Rollback operations can be performed at any time using Git Revert, and the Git repository will not change versions over time.
- **Automatic Pull**: Once the declarative state is merged into the Git repository, it means that the commits will be automatically applied to the cluster. This deployment method is safe and efficient, requiring no manual intervention during the deployment process; the entire process is automated, eliminating the possibility of human error. Additionally, human approval steps can be integrated into the deployment process to ensure security.
- **Continuous Reconciliation and Self-healing**: The reconciliation process relies on controllers like Argo CD, which periodically pull from the Git repository and compare differences. The differences are then applied to the cluster, ensuring that the entire system can self-heal.

## Advantages of GitOps <a id="gitops-advantage" />

- **Simplified Team Collaboration and Increased Delivery Speed**: Describing the necessary infrastructure, configurations, versions, and even monitoring events and target states in a declarative manner and storing them in Git enables automated deployment capabilities through GitOps controllers and other mechanisms. Once application testing is successful, it can be deployed to any environment with a single click, simplifying team collaboration and speeding up delivery.
- **Fast Rollback and Recovery**: In the event of application anomalies, leveraging Git's version management capabilities allows for fast rollback, online disaster recovery, and quick recovery from errors through the “automatic pull and continuous reconciliation” abilities of GitOps controllers.
- **Multi-environment Distribution Management**: By using Git as the only source of truth and incorporating differentiated configuration management capabilities, GitOps controllers facilitate the precise bulk distribution and operational management of applications across multi-cloud and multi-environment setups.
- **Enhanced Security and Compliance**: Utilizing Git to store configuration files, and leveraging Git's built-in roles, permissions control, branching, auditing, and encryption mechanisms, helps protect environment and other sensitive information, thereby enhancing security and compliance.

## Common GitOps Tools

- **ArgoCD**: A popular declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool designed for Kubernetes. It enables applications to be defined, configured, and their environments to be declarative and version-controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.
- **Flux**: A lightweight Kubernetes GitOps tool that continuously monitors Git repositories and automatically deploys or updates applications in Kubernetes based on configuration files.
- **Jenkins X**: An automated CI/CD platform that supports integration with GitOps, providing continuous delivery and automated deployment capabilities through GitOps.
