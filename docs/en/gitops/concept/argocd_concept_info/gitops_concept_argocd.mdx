# Introduction to Argo CD

Argo CD is a very popular open-source GitOps tool. To use Argo CD, you need to understand the following core concepts:   ../../concept/argocd\_concept\_info/concept\_argocd\_tool\_kustomize.mdx

1. Application: A declarative, custom Kubernetes resource (CRD) used to define the desired state of an application. [Deep Dive into Application](../../concept/argocd_concept_info/concept_argocd_application.mdx)
2. ApplicationSet: A Kubernetes controller that adds support for the ApplicationSet CustomResourceDefinition (CRD). It allows you to generate multiple Applications using a single template. An ApplicationSet can be thought of as a factory for Applications, capable of generating multiple Application instances based on different parameters. [Deep Dive into ApplicationSet](../../concept/argocd_concept_info/concept_argocd_applicationset.mdx)
3. Tool: Used to specify the tool type utilized for the Application source type, such as Kustomize. [Deep Dive into Tool](../../concept/argocd_concept_info/concept_argocd_tool.mdx)
4. Sync: The process of synchronizing the application to achieve the desired state. For example, by applying changes to the Kubernetes cluster. [Deep Dive into Sync](../../concept/argocd_concept_info/concept_argocd_sync.mdx)
5. Health: The health status that indicates the health of an Argo CD Application, including whether it is running properly and can handle requests. [Deep Dive into Health](../../concept/argocd_concept_info/concept_argocd_health.mdx)

## Summary of Differences Between Application and ApplicationSet

| **Attribute**       | **Application**            | **ApplicationSet**                                    |
| :------------------ | :------------------------  | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition          | Deployment and configuration of a single application | A template for a set of similar applications to generate multiple Application instances             |
| Configuration       | Static configuration       | Dynamic configuration, generating parameters to fill the Application template                  |
| Deployment          | Deploying a single application | Generating and deploying multiple Application instances                        |
| Use Case            | Deploying a single application with simple configuration to a single environment | Deploying multiple similar applications with complex configuration, requiring deployment in multiple environments or clusters, and needing to dynamically generate application instances based on different parameters |
| Core Concepts       | Git repository, target cluster, deployment strategy, etc. | Generators, templates, parameters, placeholders                                     |
| Relation to Argo CD | The basic deployment unit of Argo CD | An advanced feature of Argo CD for bulk management of Applications                       |

## Argo CD Status Explanation

| **Sync Status**      | **Description**                                                 |
| :------------------  | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Synced**          | The Live State of the Application is completely in line with the Desired State.              |
| **OutOfSync**       | The Live State of the Application is not in line with the Desired State and requires synchronization. |
| **Syncing**         | The Application is currently undergoing synchronization, with the Live State moving towards the Desired State. |
