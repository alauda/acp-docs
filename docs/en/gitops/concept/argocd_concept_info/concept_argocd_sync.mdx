# In-Depth Understanding of Sync

## Overview of Sync

Sync is a core feature of Argo CD that is responsible for comparing an application’s **Desired State** with its **Live State**, and taking actions to ensure they remain consistent. In simple terms, Sync is the process of aligning the state of applications in your Kubernetes cluster with the state defined in your Git repository. You can manually trigger Sync or configure Argo CD to perform Sync automatically. Automatic Sync can be triggered by listening to changes in the Git repository (such as commits, pushed tags, etc.) or can be conducted at predefined intervals.

## Overview of Sync Status

Sync State indicates the synchronization status of the application, reflecting whether the application’s **Live State** matches the **Desired State**. The Sync State can have the following statuses:

- `Synced`: The application's Live State is completely aligned with the Desired State.
- `OutOfSync`: The application's Live State does not match the Desired State.
- `Syncing`: The application is currently undergoing a synchronization operation, with the Live State moving toward the Desired State.

## Overview of Sync Operator State

Sync Operator State indicates the status of the synchronization operation executed by Argo CD, reflecting whether the synchronization operation was completed successfully. The Sync Operator State can have the following statuses:

- `Succeeded`: The synchronization operation completed successfully.
- `Failed`: The synchronization operation failed due to reasons such as Kubernetes resource conflicts or insufficient permissions.
- `Running`: The synchronization operation is currently ongoing.

## Overview of Refresh

Refresh is used to update the Desired State and Live State of applications within Argo CD. The Refresh operation pulls the latest application configurations from the Git repository and compares them with the actual state in the Kubernetes cluster. Refresh can be manually triggered or configured for automatic operation by Argo CD.
