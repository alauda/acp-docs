# Understanding Helm in Depth

## Introduction

Helm is a package management tool for Kubernetes that allows users to define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications. Helm charts are templated configurations of Helm packages that include definitions of Kubernetes resources (YAML files).

## Core Concepts of Helm

- Chart: A Helm chart is a templated configuration of a Helm package that includes definitions of Kubernetes resources (YAML files).
- Release: A Helm release is an instance of a Helm chart that includes definitions of Kubernetes resources (YAML files).
- Values: Helm values are parameterized configurations of Helm charts, allowing users to customize definitions of Kubernetes resources (YAML files).

The integration of Argo CD and Helm makes GitOps practices more efficient, enabling declarative continuous delivery through the platform UI, Argo CD Dashboard, and CLI, as demonstrated below:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: sealed-secrets
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    chart: sealed-secrets
    repoURL: https://bitnami-labs.github.io/sealed-secrets
    targetRevision: 1.16.1
    helm:
      releaseName: sealed-secrets
  destination:
    server: "https://kubernetes.default.svc"
    namespace: kubeseal
```

OCI Helm Chart Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    chart: nginx
    repoURL: registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts  # note: the oci:// syntax is not included.
    targetRevision: 15.9.0
  destination:
    name: "in-cluster"
    namespace: nginx
```

:::info

- The lifecycle of the Application is controlled by Argo CD, not by Helm.
- When providing values in multiple ways: the precedence order is parameters > valuesObject > values > valueFiles > helm repository values.yaml.
:::

## Advantages

- Templating: Helm uses the Go templating engine (gotpl) to dynamically generate Kubernetes resource files.

- Package Management: Helm packages applications as Charts (which include templates, default values, and dependencies), making them easy to distribute and version control.

- Dependency Management: Supports dependencies between Charts.

- Lifecycle Management: Provides commands such as `install`, `upgrade`, and `rollback` to manage the entire lifecycle of applications.

## Use Cases

- Deployment of Complex Applications: Suitable for scenarios that require dynamic configuration generation, such as generating resources based on environment variables or user input.

- Multi-Environment Deployment: Allows for configuration support in different environments through the `values.yaml` file.

- Application Distribution: Ideal for packaging applications as Charts and publishing them to Helm repositories, OCI Chart repositories, etc.
