# In-Depth Understanding of Health

## Introduction to Health

Health is used to indicate the health status of Argo CD's Application. Is it running normally? Is it capable of handling requests?

## Health Scope

|        Health Status       |                        Description                        |
| :------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
|    ***Health***           |                       Resource health                      |
| ***Progressing***         |     The resource is not yet healthy but is in the process of being handled and should soon reach the ***Health*** state.    |
|   ***Degraded***          |                     Resource health status is degraded.                    |
|  ***Suspended***          |  The resource is suspended and waiting for certain external events to resume, such as a suspended CronJob or suspended Deployment. |

## Reference Material

Argo CD provides built-in health assessments for several standard Kubernetes types, reflecting these assessments in the overall health status of the application. Of course, Argo CD also supports custom health checks. For more detailed explanations, please refer to: [Health](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/)
