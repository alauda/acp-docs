# In-Depth Understanding of Tool

## Tool Introduction

The Tool refers to the tools used for generating or processing Kubernetes resource manifests `Manifests`.

## Scope of Tool Support

Argo CD supports several different ways of defining Kubernetes manifests:

- Kustomize Applications [In-Depth Understanding of Kustomize](./concept_argocd_tool_kustomize.mdx)
- Helm Charts [In-Depth Understanding of Helm](./concept_argocd_tool_helm.mdx)
- Directory: manifests with `YAML`/`JSON`/`Jsonnet`, including `Jsonnet` [In-Depth Understanding of Directory](./concept_argocd_tool_directory.mdx)
- Any custom configuration management tools configured as configuration management plugins

## Development Process

Argo CD can also directly upload local `manifests`, but this is only for development purposes. The `override` can only be uploaded locally by users with permission (usually administrators). It supports all the different Kubernetes deployment tools mentioned above. To upload a local application:

```bash
$ argocd app sync APPNAME --local /path/to/dir/
```

## Comparison Summary

|      Feature      |        Helm       |       Kustomize      | Directory (Pure YAML) |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :------------------: | :---------------: |
|     Configuration Method     |    Templated (Dynamically generated)    | Declarative (Patch and Overlay) |     Static YAML files    |
|      Reusability     |    High (through Charts)    | Medium (through Base and Overlay) |         Low         |
|     Multi-environment Support    | High (through values.yaml) |     High (through Overlay)    |         Low         |
|     Progressive Release    |     High (supports complex logic)     |     Medium (supports simple Patch)    |         Low         |
|     Learning Curve     |    High (requires learning template syntax)    |      Low (based on YAML)      |         Low         |
| Integration with Argo CD |         Supported        |         Native support         |         Supported        |
|     Use Cases     |   Complex applications, multiple environments, application distribution   |       Multiple environments, configuration reuse       |    Small projects, rapid prototyping    |
