# In-depth Understanding of Directory

## Introduction

The Directory type application can load `manifest` files from .yml, .yaml, or .json files. Directory type applications can be created through the platform UI, Argo CD Dashboard, CLI, or by using a declarative approach. The declaration syntax is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: guestbook
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: default
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: default
  source:
    path: guestbook
    repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
```

In addition to adding the required configuration options, there is no need to include the `spec.source.directory` field. Argo CD will automatically detect whether the `source repository/path` contains `manifest` files.

## Advantages

- Supports loading various types of resources from `manifest` files, making it simple and easy to understand.

- No extra configuration management is needed, resulting in lower maintenance costs.

## Use Cases

- When there is a need to manage multiple Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.

- For small projects with fewer resources or for those wanting to quickly understand GitOps.

- To deploy native YAML files directly without the need for complex configuration management or dynamic generation capabilities.

:::warning
Directory type applications are only suitable for `plain manifest` files. If `Directory:` is set, and Argo CD encounters `Kustomize`, `Helm`, or `Jsonnet` files, it will be unable to render the `manifest` files.
