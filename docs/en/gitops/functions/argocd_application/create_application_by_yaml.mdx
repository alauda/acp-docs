# Creating an Argo CD Application using YAML

## Function Overview

With the application management capability of Alauda GitOps, you can quickly create Argo CD Applications using YAML files, achieving full lifecycle management of containerized applications through GitOps.

## Prerequisites

- The global cluster has deployed the Alauda GitOps cluster plugin.
  **Note**: If it has not been deployed, please contact the platform administrator to deploy it for you.
- Git repository integration, one of the following methods must be chosen:
  - [Integrate the code repository through Argo CD](../../how_to/argocd_git.mdx)
  - You must have management permissions for the project, and the platform administrator must have integrated or deployed the GitLab repository in the Toolchain Management > Toolchain Integration section and assigned it to your project.

## Creating an Application using YAML

### Creating an Application through Alauda GitOps Platform UI

> The steps are as follows:

1. In the left navigation bar, click **GitOps Applications**.
2. Click **Create GitOps Application**.
3. Switch to the **YAML** tab.
4. In the **YAML** area, refer to the following YAML file and configure the relevant information. Replace `namespace` and `project` with your own namespace and project.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: guestbook
  namespace: argocd # Replace with your own namespace
spec:
  project: default # Replace with your own project
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj/argocd-example-apps.git
    targetRevision: master
    path: helm-guestbook
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: guestbook
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=true
```

5. Click **Create**.

### Creating an Application through Platform CLI

If the web-cli plugin is installed and the `web-cli` switch is enabled.

```bash
kubectl apply -f application.yaml
```
