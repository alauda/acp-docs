# Create Argo CD Application via Platform UI

## Feature Overview

With the Alauda GitOps application management capability, visualize the creation of Argo CD Applications, achieving full lifecycle management of containerized applications through GitOps.

## Prerequisites

- The global cluster has deployed the Alauda GitOps cluster plugin.

  **Note**: If not deployed, please contact the platform administrator for deployment.

- Git repository integration can be done using one of the following methods:
  - [Integrate Code Repository via Argo CD](../../how_to/argocd_git.mdx)
  - You need to have management permissions for the project, and the platform administrator has integrated or deployed the GitLab repository in Toolchain Management > Toolchain Integration, assigned for your project's use.

## Functional Advantages

- Visual GitOps application distribution management: By combining the platform's multi-cluster management and differentiated configuration capabilities, achieve a unified visual GitOps application management and cluster configuration management style, making precise distribution in multi-cloud and multi-environment scenarios simpler and easier to use.

| **Integrated Project Name** | The project name of the integrated tool assigned or associated by the platform administrator for your project use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Version Identifier**      | Supports creating applications based on Branch, Tag, or Commit in the code repository. <br />**Note:** <br /> - When the version identifier is Branch, it only supports creating applications using the latest Commit in the selected branch. <br /> - When the version identifier is Tag or Commit, it defaults to selecting the latest Tag or Commit in the code repository, but you can choose other versions as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Source File Type**      | Select the file type of resource files that require differentiated configurations based on the **Source File Directory**. This parameter is associated with the **Differentiated Configuration** in the **Distribution Location** section. <br />**Kustomize**: The Kustomize Overlay directory contains Kustomization files and resource files describing how to modify the base configuration. For details, refer to the [Kustomize Official Documentation](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/zh/guides/). You can choose the Overlay directory when distributing the application instance to achieve differentiated configuration. <br />**Helm**: The Helm Values file contains various configuration options, parameters, and settings for the application, which can be referenced by the template engine to generate configuration files as needed, allowing configurations to be reused and adjusted across different environments. For more details, refer to the [Helm Official Documentation](https://helm.sh/zh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/). You can select Value files during application instance distribution to implement differentiated configurations. <br />**Directory**: Resources under the selected **Source File Directory and its subdirectories** will be distributed to the target cluster. |
| **Source File Directory**      | The directory in the repository where the base configuration resides, allowing the selection of the root directory. Resources under this directory will be distributed to the target cluster, where the target cluster will deploy resources and create applications based on the resource files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Custom Values** | Supports selecting custom Helm Values files when the source file type is Helm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

4. In the **Distribution Location** section, refer to the following instructions to configure the relevant information.

   - **When the GitOps application type is Application**: Select a namespace under the current project to distribute the application to this namespace.

   - **When the GitOps application type is ApplicationSet**: Distribute the application to the namespace of the cluster. If the distributed application requires **differentiated configuration**, you can select the differentiated configuration files or directories as needed.

   **Note**: Differentiated configuration is only related to the **Source File Type** and does not affect the base configuration files in the **Source File Directory**, and multiple namespaces can be selected for distribution and differentiated configuration within the same cluster.

5. Set the synchronization policy. The platform will check the cluster resources and repository configurations every 3 minutes.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
   | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Manual Sync**   | When discrepancies between the resource status in the cluster and the expected status in the repository are detected, you will be prompted to perform a sync operation in a timely manner to ensure the resource status aligns with the expected state. |
   | **Automatic Sync** | When discrepancies are found, the platform will automatically trigger a sync operation without manual intervention to ensure the resource status matches the expected state.                                                                                          |
   | **Ignore Configurations for Sync** | Ignore specified fields in the selected **Source File Directory**'s resource files. After the first sync, ignored resources or fields will no longer be forcefully synchronized with the sync policy. You can choose to use the built-in or custom sync ignore configuration template to implement the ignore settings. Once configured, you can [view the ignore configuration fields in the YAML file](#viewyaml). <br />**Note**: If you need to use a custom sync ignore configuration template, please contact the platform administrator for configuration. |

6. Click **Create**.

   **Note**: When the synchronization policy is set to **Manual Sync**, you need to manually trigger a sync for the platform to pull related configurations from the repository and carry out Application distribution operations. At this point, clicking **Create** allows you to choose to sync immediately or sync later. <br />**Sync Now**: Immediately pull related configurations from the repository and carry out Application distribution operations. <br />**Sync Later**: Do not pull related configurations from the repository for now. If needed later, manually click the **Sync** button on the details page to pull related configurations from the repository.
