# Create Argo CD ApplicationSet via Platform UI

## Feature Overview

Using Alauda GitOps application management capabilities, visually create Argo CD ApplicationSet for comprehensive lifecycle management of containerized applications through GitOps.

## Prerequisites

- The global cluster has deployed the Alauda GitOps cluster plugin.

  **Note**: If not deployed, please contact your platform administrator to deploy it for you.

- Git repository integration; you may choose any of the following ways:
  - [Integrate code repository via Argo CD](../../how_to/argocd_git.mdx).
  - You must have administrative permissions for the project, and the platform administrator has integrated or deployed the GitLab repository in Toolchain Management > Toolchain Integration for use by your project.

## Advantages

- Visual GitOps application distribution management: combined with the platform's multi-cluster management, differentiated configuration, and more capabilities, achieving a unified visual GitOps application management and cluster configuration management aligned with the platform's style, making precise distribution across multi-clouds and multi-environments simpler and easier to use.

Simple and easy to use, with lower resource consumption, allows applications to be distributed to specified namespaces.<br /> **ApplicationSet**: An ApplicationSet defined by Argo CD. Multi-level overriding differentiated configurations that can be used for cross-cluster and cross-namespace distribution, suitable for scenarios such as multi-environment distribution, disaster recovery, or edge cases. |
| **Source**         | **Platform Integration**: Choose from code repositories integrated with the platform and assigned for use by the current project; the platform supports GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket.<br /> **Argo CD Integration**: Choose from code repositories integrated via Argo CD that support GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitee, and Gitea; for specific integration methods, please refer to [Integrate code repository via Argo CD]                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Integration Project Name** | The name of the integrated tool project assigned or associated with your project by the platform administrator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Version Identifier**   | Supports creating applications based on the Branch, Tag, or Commit in the code repository.<br />**Note:** <br /> - When the version identifier is Branch, only the latest Commit under the selected branch is supported to create the application.<br /> - When the version identifier is Tag or Commit, the latest Tag or Commit in the code repository is selected by default, and you can choose other versions as needed.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Source File Type**    | Based on the **Source File Directory**, choose the file type of the resource files that require differentiated configuration; this parameter is related to the **Differentiated Configuration** area.<br />**Kustomize**: The Kustomization file and resource files in the Kustomize Overlay directory describe how to modify the base configuration; for more details, please refer to the [Kustomize Official Documentation](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/zh/guides/). You can select the Overlay directory during application instance distribution to implement differentiated configuration.<br />**Helm**: The Helm Value file contains various configuration options, parameters, and settings for the application; these values can be referenced by the template engine to generate configuration files as needed, allowing configuration to be reused and adjusted across different environments; for more details, please refer to the [Helm Official Documentation](https://helm.sh/zh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/). You can select the Value file during application instance distribution to implement differentiated configuration.<br />**Directory**: All resources under the selected **Source File Directory and its subdirectories** will be distributed to the target cluster. |
| **Source File Directory** | The repository directory containing the base configuration, allowing the selection of the root directory. The resources under this directory will be distributed to the target cluster, with the target cluster deploying resources and creating applications based on the resource files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Custom Values**     | When the source file type is Helm, you can select a custom Helm Values file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

4. In the **Distribution Location** area, configure relevant information according to the following instructions.

   - **When the GitOps application type is Application**: Select a namespace under the current project and distribute the application to that namespace.

   - **When the GitOps application type is ApplicationSet**: Distribute the application to the namespace of the cluster; if differentiation configuration is required during distribution, you can choose the differentiated configuration file or directory as needed.

   **Note**: The differentiated configuration is only related to the **Source File Type**, does not affect the base configuration files in the **Source File Directory**, and the same cluster can simultaneously select multiple namespaces for distribution and differentiated configuration.

5. Set the synchronization strategy; the platform checks the cluster resources and repository configuration every 3 minutes.

   | Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Manual Sync**      | When a discrepancy between the resource state in the cluster and the expected state in the repository is detected, you will be prompted to manually synchronize to ensure that the resource state remains consistent with the expected state.                                                                                         |
   | **Automatic Sync**   | When a discrepancy between the resource state in the cluster and the expected state in the repository is detected, the platform will automatically trigger synchronization without human intervention, ensuring that the resource state remains consistent with the expected state.                                                                 |
   | **Sync Ignore Configuration** | Ignore specified fields in the selected **Source File Directory** resource files; after the first synchronization, the ignored resources or fields will no longer be forcefully synchronized with the synchronization strategy. You can choose to use the platform's built-in or custom synchronization ignore configuration template to implement synchronization ignore configuration; once configured, you can [view the sync ignore configuration fields in the YAML file](#viewyaml).<br />**Note**: If you need to use a custom synchronization ignore configuration template, please contact the platform administrator for configuration.  |

6. Click **Create**.

   **Note**: When the synchronization strategy is set to **Manual Sync**, a manual synchronization must be triggered before the platform will pull relevant configurations from the repository and perform operations such as Application distribution. At this time, clicking **Create** allows you to choose to synchronize immediately or synchronize later.<br />**Synchronize Immediately**: Pull relevant configurations from the repository and perform Application distribution operations immediately.<br />**Synchronize Later**: Do not pull relevant configurations from the repository for now; you can later manually click the **Sync** button on the details page to pull relevant configurations from the repository and perform Application distribution operations.
