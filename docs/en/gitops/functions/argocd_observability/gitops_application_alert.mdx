# GitOps Application Operations

## Function Overview

With the GitOps application management capabilities provided by the platform, you can view GitOps application monitoring, real-time logs, and events. You can also create alerting policies for GitOps applications. When an abnormal situation occurs with the GitOps application, proactive alerts will be issued to facilitate quick issue identification, analysis, and resolution.

## Prerequisites

- There is an already published GitOps application on the platform. [Creating an Argo CD Application via the web console](../../how_to/create_gitops_app.mdx).

## Creating Alerting Policies

> Create alerting policies in advance to configure alerts. When the GitOps application encounters an exception, proactive notifications can be issued to facilitate quick issue identification, analysis, and resolution.

1. Click on **GitOps Applications** in the left navigation bar.

2. Click on the name of the GitOps application in the list for which you want to create an alerting policy.

3. Switch to the **Alerts** tab.

4. Click on **Create Alerting Policy** and fill in the basic information as needed.

5. Click on **Add Alert Rule** in the **Alert Rules** section. The corresponding metric descriptions are as follows:

**Note:** For configuration and description of other parameters and policy settings, please refer to Creating Alerting Policies.

| **Metric Name**                                      | **Rule Description**                                                        |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GitOps Application Health Status (gitops.applicationset.healthy) | The health status of the GitOps application:<br /> - 0: Unknown, lost, degraded, or paused <br /> - 1: In progress <br /> - 2: Healthy |
| GitOps Application Sync Status (gitops.applicationset.synced)  | The sync status of the GitOps application:<br /> - 0: Sync failed or pending sync <br /> - 1: Syncing <br /> - 2: Synced   |

6. Click **Create**.

## Real-time Logs

> Real-time logs can be viewed for all Workload resources distributed by GitOps applications. Real-time logs can quickly identify and respond to system failure information without relying on whether the logging components are deployed on the platform.

- On the GitOps application details page, under **Kubernetes Resources**, click on ***any Workload resource name*** to view the **real-time logs** information for that resource on the right side.

## Real-time Events

> Real-time events can quickly identify and respond to system failure event information without relying on whether logging components, etc. are deployed on the platform.

- On the GitOps application details page, go to the **Real-time Events** tab to view the aggregate of real-time events for all resources distributed by the GitOps application.
- On the GitOps application details page, under **Kubernetes Resources**, click on ***any resource name*** to view the **real-time events** information for that resource on the right side.
