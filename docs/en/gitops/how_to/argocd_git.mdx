# Integrating Code Repositories with Argo CD UI

Use the native Argo CD UI to integrate code repositories and allocate repositories, allowing business personnel to manage GitOps applications throughout the entire process via a visual interface.

## Use Cases

- Simplify the deployment flow of GitOps applications by choosing to use the associated repository when **creating a GitOps application** through the platform UI.
- When creating an **Application** via the native Argo CD UI, you can opt to use the associated repository.

## Prerequisites

- The GitOps cluster plugin has been deployed in the **global** cluster, and the **native Argo CD UI** switch has been enabled.
- Access to the **native Argo CD UI** URL, along with username and password; platform administrators can access the **native Argo CD UI** directly through the GitOps cluster plugin details page.

## Steps

Follow these steps to utilize the features:

1. Connect Code Repository

   - Log in to **Argo CD** using the access URL.

   - Click on **Settings** in the left navigation bar.

   - Click on the **Repositories** card.

   - Click on **CONNECT REPO** in the upper left corner of the page.

   - Choose the method to connect the repository and fill in the corresponding parameters as needed.

   - Click **CONNECT**.

2. Associate Project

   - Click on **Settings** in the left navigation bar.

   - Click on the **Projects** card.

   - Click on the project in which you need to create the GitOps application.

   Note: Argo CD will automatically sync projects in the cluster, so there is no need to create them manually.

   - Click **EDIT** in the **SOURCE REPOSITORIES** section.

   - Click **ADD SOURCE**, fill in the repository address in **Connect Repository**, and associate it with the project.

   - Click **SAVE**.

## Operation Result

Return to the platform and visit the **Create GitOps Application** page to see the associated repositories.
