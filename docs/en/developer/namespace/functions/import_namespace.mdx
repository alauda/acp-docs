# Importing Namespaces

By importing namespaces under the project, it allows flexible management of Kubernetes namespaces from any cluster on the platform. With the **Remove Namespace** feature, you can reset the affiliation relationship between a namespace and a project.

Importing the project's namespace will provide you with services equivalent to those of the namespaces created on the platform.

**Note**: A namespace belongs to only one project and cannot be imported into another project if it already belongs to a certain project.

## Use Cases

Common use cases include:

- When a new cluster connects to the platform, you can use the namespace import feature to sequentially import the existing Kubernetes namespaces under the cluster into the project's management. The operational process is illustrated in the diagram below.

  **Reference content**: [Create Project]() , [Add Project Linked Cluster]().

- A namespace that has been removed from a project can be imported into another project for management through the import namespace feature.

- Namespaces created for unassociated projects on the platform (for example: created via scripts on the cluster) must be assigned to a specific project through the import namespace feature before they can be viewed and managed on the platform.

## Prerequisites

- The namespace does not belong to any project on the platform.

- You can only import namespaces into projects that are associated with the **Cluster for the Namespace**. If there are no projects in the platform associated with the **Cluster for the Namespace**, you need to create a project that meets this condition first.

## Steps

1. In the **Project Management** view, click on the ***Project Name*** where the namespace to be imported is located.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Namespaces** > **Namespaces**.

3. Click the button next to **Create Namespace**, <span style={{ display: 'inline-flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '4px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}><img src="./assets/addoperation.png" alt="expand" style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> <span> > **Import Namespace**</span></span>.

4. Refer to the [Create Namespace](./create_namespace.mdx) parameter description to configure the relevant parameters.

5. Click **Import**.
