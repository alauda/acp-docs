# Delete/Remove Namespace

Delete or remove a namespace under the specified project.

**Delete Namespace**: This operation deletes the namespace and cleans up the existing resources under the namespace, releasing the quota resources occupied by it.

**Remove Namespace**: Removing a namespace only removes it from the project without affecting the existing resources under the namespace, such as applications, persistent volume claims, configurations, compute resources, namespace members, and their roles, etc. <br /> The removed namespace can be imported into other projects associated with the ÃŸcluster where the namespace is located. For details [Import Namespace](./import_namespace.mdx).
