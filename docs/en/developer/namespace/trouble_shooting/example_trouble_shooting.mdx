Introduce common problems that users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is brief, it can be placed directly on a single page titled "Problem Handling." If the content is extensive, "Problem Handling" should serve as a directory, with each problem treated as a separate document.

You can refer to the [example of a problem handling document](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) for a sample of the corresponding documentation.

:::

# \<Title: Generally the name of the problem>

## Problem Description

Provide a detailed account of the environment in which the problem occurs, the scope of its impact, and the symptoms of the issue, while also optionally including the following auxiliary information:

- Problem Screenshots: Textual descriptions are currently preferred. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots may be used, but users should register and discuss these needs with the documentation team.
- Relevant Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in the form of code blocks.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this issue (these can be a single confirmed cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause should fulfill the following criteria:

1. Must be a confirmed actual cause that has been proven to lead to this problem, rather than a speculative or imaginary cause.
2. Require detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How this cause triggers the problem.
   - The specific mechanisms and processes through which the problem occurs.

## Troubleshooting (Optional)

Outline specific steps for troubleshooting the issue. By conducting troubleshooting, users can select the most probable or definitive cause and use appropriate solutions to resolve the problem. Troubleshooting should observe the following:

- If there is only one root cause, troubleshooting steps need to be provided. In this case, it is recommended to display them in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different troubleshooting steps, use third-level headings to list each root cause, and provide detailed troubleshooting steps under each cause.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is how to write the title when there are multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, the second-level title should be "Solution.")

Specific notes, prerequisites, and operational steps for resolving the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level title should be "Solution." If there are multiple root causes with different solutions, each solution should have its own second-level heading named "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," etc.

### Precautions (Optional)

Precautions to take before starting the operation; failing to read this carefully may result in operational failure or even cause more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that need to be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (If there are no precautions or prerequisites, this third-level heading may be omitted)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list format. If the steps are complicated, additional headings can be used to differentiate between steps, and these can be listed using fourth-level headings, with specific action items presented in an ordered list format below each step.
- For operations conducted in a container platform, detailed steps for each action can be completely listed; for actions performed on third-party platforms or other software, only key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if the description is overly detailed, we cannot ensure timely updates to the documentation in case of interface changes, which could lead to numerous problems. Therefore, to ensure the long-term usability of the documentation, descriptions for third-party platform operation steps should adhere to the following principles:
  >
  > - Highlight core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid excessive reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain the generality and flexibility of operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the operational purpose and basic processes.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is how to write the title when there are multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be removed.)

This section is consistent in format with the solution for Root Cause 1 and will not be further reiterated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of this issue (suggestions, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

Can include some content used in the document that is not convenient to place in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
