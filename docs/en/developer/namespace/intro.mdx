# Introduction

Refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/en/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)

> In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespace-based scoping is applicable only for namespaced objects (e.g. Deployments, Services, etc.) and not for cluster-wide objects (e.g. StorageClass, Nodes, PersistentVolumes, etc.).
