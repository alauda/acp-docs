# Events

Event information generated based on changes to Kubernetes resources and various operational statuses, accompanied by visual query capabilities. When applications, compute components, and other resources encounter abnormal situations, real-time events can be used to analyze and identify the specific causes.

## Operational Steps

> This example illustrates how to view real-time logs of containers through the deployment page.

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Compute Components** > **Deployments**.

2. Click the name of the deployment from the list.

3. Switch to the **Real-Time Events** page for detailed event information.

- **Resource Event Records**: Below the overview area of important events, all event records that meet the query conditions within the specified time range are displayed. You can filter respective types of events by clicking on the important event cards or expand to input query conditions. The query conditions are described as follows:

  - **Resource Type**: The type of Kubernetes resource where the event occurred, such as Pod.

  - **Namespace**: The namespace of the Kubernetes resource where the event took place.

  - **Event Reason**: The reason why the event occurred (reason).

  - **Event Level**: The significance of the event, such as Warning.

  - **Resource Name**: The name of the Kubernetes resource where the event occurred. Supports selecting or entering multiple names.

:::tip

- Click the view icon next to the resource name of the event record to view detailed information of the event in the pop-up **Event Details** dialog.
- The color of the icon to the left of the event reason indicates the event level. A green icon indicates that the event level is `Normal` and can be ignored; an orange icon indicates that the event level is `Warning`, suggesting that there is an anomaly with the resource, and attention is required to prevent faults.
- Kubernetes allows configuring the duration for storing event information, with a default of 1 hour on the platform. Expired events are automatically cleaned up. To view more and more detailed event information, please click on [All Events](../../observability/event/event.mdx).
