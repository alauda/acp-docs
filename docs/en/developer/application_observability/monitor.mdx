# Monitoring

- Supports viewing resource monitoring data for workload components on the platform for the past 7 days (with configurable monitoring data retention period), including statistical data on applications, workloads, and pods, as well as trends and rankings for resource usage such as CPU and memory.
- Supports cluster-based monitoring.
- The workloads that support viewing monitoring data include **Applications**, **Deployments**, **DaemonSets**, **StatefulSets**, and **Pods**. 
This document will use Deployments as an example for explanation.

## Namespace-Level Monitoring

1. Container Platform, in the left navigation bar, click on **Observability** > **Dashboard**.

2. You can view monitoring data under the namespace; We provide three monitoring dashboards based on **Applications Overview**, **Workloads Overview**, and **Pods Overview**.

3. You can switch to any panel to monitor the resources of interest.

## Create a Namespace-Level Monitoring manage_dashboard

1. Under **Platform Management**, refer to [Create Monitoring Dashboard](../../observability/monitor/functions/manage_dashboard.mdx#｛#create_dashboard｝) to create a dedicated monitoring dashboard.
2. Adjust the following Label information to display the Namespace-Level Monitoring dashboard on the container platform:
   - `cpaas.io/dashboard.folder: container-platform`
   - `cpaas.io/dashboard.tag.overview: "true"`

## Monitoring Under the Workloads 

> This section introduces viewing the **Monitoring** of pod via the deployments page.

### Default Monitoring Dashboard

1. In the left navigation bar, click on **Workloads** -> **Deployments**.

2. Click on the name of the ***Deployment Name*** in the list.

3. Switch to the **Monitoring** page to view the monitoring data of the **Default** within the monitoring page.

## Monitoring Data Explanation

**Note**: Hovering the cursor over the chart curve allows you to view detailed data for each pod at the current time point, as well as the PromQL expression. If there are more than 15 pods, the values are sorted in descending order, and only the top 15 entries are displayed.

| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**             | Usage Rate / Usage Amount   | **Usage Rate** = Usage Value / Limit Value (limits)<br />You can determine whether the limit values configured for computing component containers are reasonable by checking the usage rate; if the usage rate is too high, it indicates that the limit values set for the container are too low, which may affect the normal operation of the computing component.<br />**Usage Amount** is the amount of resources used by the computing component. |
| **Memory**          | Usage Rate / Usage Amount   | **Usage Rate** = Usage Value / Limit Value (limits)<br />You can determine whether the limit values configured for computing component containers are reasonable by checking the usage rate; if the usage rate is too high, it indicates that the limit values set for the container are too low, which may affect the normal operation of the computing component.<br />**Usage Amount** is the amount of resources used by the computing component. |
| **Network Traffic** | Inbound / Outbound          | The network traffic flowing into/out of the container group per second.                                                                                           |
| **Network Packet Count** | Received / Sent         | The network packet count received/sent by the container group per second.                                                                                         |
| **Disk Rate**      | Read / Write                | The read/write rate of mounted partitions for each container group in the computing component.                                                                          |
| **Disk IOPS**      | Read / Write                | The Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) of the mounted partitions for each container group in the computing component.                                          |

## Custum 
4. Click the **Toggle Icon** to switch to the custom monitoring dashboard page and refer to [Add Pannel in Custom Dashboard](../../observability/monitor/functions/manage_dashboard.mdx) to create a dedicated monitoring dashboard.
