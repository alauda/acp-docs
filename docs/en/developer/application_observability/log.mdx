# Logs

Based on Kubernetes log information, it provides a visual querying capability. When applications, computing components, and other resources exhibit abnormal conditions, real-time logs can be used to analyze and pinpoint specific causes.

## Steps to Operate

> Taking the deployment page to view the real-time logs of a container as an example.

1. In the left navigation bar, click on **Compute Components** > **Deployments**.

2. Click on the name of the deployment in the list.

3. Switch to the **Real-time Logs** page, with specific operations as follows.

   | Operation         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
   | :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Container Group / Container** | You can switch between **Container Group** and **Container** to view the corresponding logs.                                                                                                                      |
   | **Logs Before Restart** | When a container restarts for some reason, you can switch to **Logs Before Restart** to view the log information from the most recent restart.                                                                                     |
   | **Line Count**     | You can switch the line count to view 1000, 10000, or 100000 lines of logs.                                                                                                                                                   |
   | **Line Wrapping**     | When the length of the log content exceeds the screen display, the excess part will be automatically wrapped to the next line; this feature is enabled by default.                                                                      |
   | **Search**     | Search for specific characters, with matching characters highlighted, and press the Enter key to find the next match.                                                                                                                              |
   | **Trimming**     | When the log content exceeds 2000 characters, the excess part will be trimmed and replaced with **...**. The trimmed log content cannot be matched using the search function. You can view the full log using the following methods: <ul><li>Click on the trimmed log to pop up a dialog with the full log information, which can be used in conjunction with the browserâ€™s search function. Click the log or the blank area on the page again to cancel the dialog.</li><li>Use the **Export** function to view the complete log information.</li></ul> |

:::warning

- When there are logs displayed outside of the upper and lower areas of the page, trimmed logs, or formatted colored characters, directly copying may lead to loss of the copied log information. To avoid this, it is recommended to view and copy the complete log information from the original page.
- Real-time logs read log information directly from within the container, providing better real-time performance, but they will be dynamically cleaned up based on the storage scale configured by Kubernetes. To view more log information, you can check the [Logs](../../observability/log/functions/log.mdx) in the left navigation under **Observability**.
