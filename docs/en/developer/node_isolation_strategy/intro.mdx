# Introduction

Node Isolation Strategy provides a project-level node isolation strategy that allows projects to exclusively use cluster nodes.

## Advantages

Conveniently allocate nodes to projects in an exclusive or shared manner, preventing resource contention between projects.

## Application Scenarios

Node Isolation Strategy is suitable for scenarios where enhanced resource isolation between projects is required, and where there is a desire to prevent other projects' components from occupying nodes, which could lead to resource constraints or inability to meet performance requirements.
