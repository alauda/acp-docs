# Architecture

![Node Isolation Strategy Architecture](./assets/node-isolation.png "Node Isolation Strategy Architecture")

Node Isolation Strategy is implemented based on the Container Platform Cluster Core component, providing the capability of node isolation between projects by allocating nodes on each workload cluster. When containers are created in a project, they are forcibly scheduled to the nodes allocated to that specific project.
