Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.).
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document to introduce multiple concepts. Conversely, it is recommended to introduce each concept in a separate document.
For obscure or complex concepts, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more digestible introduction.

You can visit the [Concept Documentation Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to view examples of corresponding documents.
