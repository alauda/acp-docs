# Monitoring and Alerts

## Monitoring

In the **Monitoring** tab of the component, you can view the monitoring data of the application for the past 7 days.

**Note**: The GPU-related monitoring charts are visible only when the application utilizes GPU resources.

| Monitoring Resource    | Data Statistical Granularity | Metric Description                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**                | Usage Rate/Usage Amount      | **Usage Rate** = Usage Value / Limit Value (limits)<br />You can determine whether the component container's limit value configuration is reasonable by using the usage rate. A high usage rate indicates that the container's limit value is set too low, which may affect the normal operation of the component.<br />**Usage Amount** is the amount of resources used by the component. |
| **Memory**             | Usage Rate/Usage Amount      | **Usage Rate** = Usage Value / Limit Value (limits)<br />You can determine whether the component container's limit value configuration is reasonable by using the usage rate. A high usage rate indicates that the container's limit value is set too low, which may affect the normal operation of the component.<br />**Usage Amount** is the amount of resources used by the component. |
| **Network Traffic**    | Incoming/Outgoing             | The total network traffic rate of all container groups in the component.                                                                                     |
| **Network Packet Count**| Received/Sent                 | The total rate of network packet count of all container groups in the component.                                                                                        |
| **Disk Rate**         | Read/Write                   | The total read and write rate of mounted partitions of all container groups in the component.                                                                                |
| **Disk IOPS**         | Read/Write                   | The total IOPS of mounted partitions of all container groups in the component.                                                                                         |
| **Virtual/Physical GPU**| Usage Rate/Usage Amount      | **Usage Rate** = Usage Value / Limit Value (limits)<br />**Usage Amount** is the amount of resources used by the component.                                                                   |
| **Virtual/Physical GPU Memory** | Usage Rate/Usage Amount | **Usage Rate** = Usage Value / Limit Value (limits)<br />**Usage Amount** is the amount of resources used by the component.                                                                   |

## Alerts

1. **Configure Alert Policies**: To enable alerts, please first refer to the platform-wide guide [Create Alert Policy]() in the component's **Alerts** tab. The alert policy describes the objects you wish to monitor, the conditions under which you want to receive alerts, and how you will be notified of relevant alerts.

2. **Handle Alerts**: When the interface indicates that there are strategies in an alert state, please address them promptly.

3. **Bind Notification Policies**: In addition to viewing real-time alerts, the platform also supports sending alert information to relevant personnel via email, SMS, and other means to notify them to take necessary measures to resolve issues or prevent failures. Notification policies need to be set up by contacting the administrator before use.
