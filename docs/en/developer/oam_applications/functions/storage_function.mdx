# Adding Storage and Configuration

Typically, the settings for application resources (storage and configuration) are completed during the application creation process. This section will introduce how to add new storage and configurations.

## Adding Storage

1. Go to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **OAM Applications**.

3. Click on ***application name***.

4. In the **Application Resources** tab, click **Add Resource**.

5. Refer to the following instructions to complete the related configuration.

   | Parameter    | Description                                                                                                                                             |
   | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Storage Class** | <ul><li>The storage class represents different types of storage characteristics, such as whether online expansion is supported, whether volume snapshots are supported, and whether high availability is provided.</li><li>Each storage class supports persistent storage of data at the underlying storage level, meaning it will not be deleted when the application stops or restarts.</li><li>Storage classes are typically set by administrators, and you can flexibly choose the storage class that meets your expectations.</li></ul> |
   | **Capacity**     | This refers to the storage quota, and the quota size depends on your application's consumption. If the set value is large, please confirm with the administrator that there is sufficient available storage space.                                                                                                         |
