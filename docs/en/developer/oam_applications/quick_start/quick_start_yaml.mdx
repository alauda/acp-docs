# Creating OAM Applications Using YAML Files

There are three ways to create an OAM application: **creating applications using built-in components and operational features**, **creating applications using custom components and operational features**, and **creating applications using YAML files**. This document aims to guide you in quickly understanding and creating a simple OAM application using a YAML file.

## Introduction

### Applicable Scenarios

If you are already proficient in creating applications and wish to migrate applications quickly within the cluster, using YAML files allows you to configure the required components and operational features with a single click.

### Estimated Reading Time

The estimated time to read through this document and perform the operations is approximately 3-5 minutes.

## Precautions

- This document does not provide detailed explanations and configurations for parameters during the configuration process, and it serves as a quick reference. For specific instructions and configuration steps, please refer to the relevant documentation.

- If you are using a YAML file exported from an existing OAM application, please be careful to modify the application name and component names in the YAML to avoid name duplication within the same namespace.

## Prerequisites

- In-depth understanding of OAM applications.

- OAM-related functionalities must be enabled.

## Steps to Operate

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **OAM Applications**.

3. Click **Create Application**.

4. Select the option to **Create via YAML**.

5. Input the YAML content and click **Create**.

   **Note**: In addition to the YAML examples provided by the platform, you can also visit the [OAM Open Source Community](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/blob/master/7.application.md) for more guidance on writing application YAMLs.
