# CUE

The platform uses CUE for the description of custom components and operation characteristics, placing CUE as a core dependency and extension method for application delivery, enabling the definition and delivery of production-level applications in a programmable manner.

## Overview

CUE is an open-source data constraint language designed for managing configuration, structure, and data. It extends the concepts of JSON, allowing users to handle configuration information as easily as they would with JSON. The CUE project is entirely written in Go, enabling users to leverage various necessary functionalities provided by CUE, such as encoding, strings, math, and more, to accomplish common configuration tasks. By implementing CUE in Go and providing a rich set of APIs, users can easily address data constraint problems.

## Basic Syntax

CUE features a streamlined syntax that is easy to learn and use. For more details, please refer to [Getting Started with CUE](https://kubevela.io/zh/docs/platform-engineers/cue/basic/), [CUE Tutorials](https://cuetorials.com/), and [Official Documentation](https://cuelang.org/docs/).

| CUE Syntax          | Description                                                                                                                                                         |

| **cue**             | Describes using CUE.                                                                                                                                              |
| **parameter**       | Parameter settings. This parameter is exposed for use and can be invoked in subsequent modules using the format `parameter.xxx`.                                   |
| **output**          | Defines a template for the main workload structural data. For example, a custom composite component Deployment + Service, where Deployment can be regarded as the main workload. |
| **outputs**         | Defines templates for auxiliary resource structural data. For example, in a custom composite component Deployment + Service, Service can be considered an auxiliary resource, defined using `outputs: service:`. |
| **...**             | Can accommodate multiple data or fields. For example, `[string]` indicates that the array can only contain elements of type string, while `[...string]` indicates that the array can hold multiple elements of type string. |
| **?:**              | Defines an optional variable. The value can either be provided or omitted and is typically used with conditional statements.                                        |
| **a: \*1 \| int**   | `*` specifies the default value of the variable, and in conjunction with `|`, defines an int type variable a with a default value of 1.                         |
| **\_\|\_**          | Represents an empty value.                                                                                                                                      |
| **\\(key)**         | References an object and replaces that portion of content with the corresponding value. For example, a=3 and the existing statement v\\(a), the final output would be v3. |
| **context.xxx**     | Uses runtime information to replace this content. For a comprehensive list of available `context`, please refer to [Complete Available Context in Component](https://kubevela.io/zh/docs/platform-engineers/components/custom-component/#full-available-context-in-component). |
| **\\\\**            | Comment content for user understanding, which has no practical effect.                                                                                           |
| **\\\ +usage**      | A specific comment format used to provide information regarding the purpose of parameters, fields, or other elements, allowing this information to be included in documentation or displayed to users in the user interface. On the platform, this will be shown as explanatory information for parameters. |
| **for**             | Loops through statements based on conditions. For more details, refer to [More Syntax](https://kubevela.io/docs/platform-engineers/cue/basic/#advanced-cue-schematic). |
| **if**              | Conditional statement.                                                                                                                                           |

| **metadata.annotations**    | Optional Field | <ul><li>`definition.oam.cpaas.io/name: '{"zh": "中文名称", "en": "英文名称"}'`: The name of the custom component.</li><li>`definition.oam.cpaas.io/tag: '{"zh": "中文标签", "en": "英文标签"}' `: The label of the custom component.</li><li>`definition.oam.cpaas.io/description: '{"zh": "中文描述", "en": "英文描述"}'`: The description of the custom component.</li></ul> |

### Explanations for Other Fields of Custom Operation Characteristics

For specific field descriptions of custom operation characteristics, please refer to [Operation Characteristics Definition](https://kubevela.io/docs/platform-engineers/oam/x-definition/#traitdefinition).

| Field                         | Default and Type       | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **metadata.labels**          | Optional Field        | `definition.oam.cpaas.io/tags: xxx`: The type of operation characteristic. Optional items include: dynamic (dynamic feature), config (additional configuration), network (network), and monitor (monitoring analysis). |
| **spec.definition**          | Optional Field        | The Kubernetes resource definition corresponding to the operation characteristic. If the operational capability is provided through Kubernetes' RD method, this item can be filled out, where apiVersion and kind describe the resource group and resource type behind it, respectively. |
| **spec.workloadRefPath**     | Optional Field        | The path to the reference field for the workload object in the operational capability. If the operation capability involves a reference to the workload, a path address can be filled in (e.g., to operate on the HPA object that manages elastic scaling, one can fill in the `spec.scaleTargetRef` field). Subsequently, the platform will automatically inject the instantiation reference of the workload into the instance object of the operational capability. |
| **spec.appliesToWorkloads**  | Optional Field, Array of Strings | A list of workload names to which the operational characteristic can be adapted, indicating that this operational characteristic can be used for one or a group of workload types. |
| **spec.conflictsWith**       | Optional Field, Array of Strings | A list of other operational characteristics that conflict with this operational characteristic, indicating which operational characteristics conflict with this one. |
| **spec.podDisruptive**       | Optional Field, Boolean Type | Indicates whether parameter updates for the operational capability will cause underlying resources (Pods) to restart. This marker can typically remind users that changes to operational characteristics should possibly be combined with a gradual release to avoid significant resource restarts leading to service unavailability or other risks. |
| **spec.manageWorkload**      | Optional Field, Boolean Type | Indicates whether this operational characteristic manages the workload. Setting this to true signifies that this operational characteristic will be responsible for creating, updating, and reclaiming resources for the workload; operational characteristics with gradual release typically have this ability. |
| **spec.skipRevisionAffect**  | Optional Field, Boolean Type | Indicates whether this operational characteristic is not counted towards version change calculations. Setting this to true means that modifications to this operational characteristic will not count towards version changes, meaning user modifications to this operational characteristic in the application will not trigger changes in the application's version itself. |
| **spec.revisionEnabled**     | Optional Field, Boolean Type | Indicates whether the operational capability is aware of changes in component versions. Setting this to true means that the resources generated by the component will have version suffixes. |
| **spec.controlPlaneOnly**    | Optional Field, Boolean Type | Indicates whether the resources generated by the operational capability are deployed to the control cluster. Setting this to true indicates that the resources generated by the operational characteristic will be deployed to the control cluster, i.e., to the global cluster. |
