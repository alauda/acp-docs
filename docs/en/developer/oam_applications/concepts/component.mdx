# In-Depth Understanding of Components

Components are an essential part of OAM applications, representing a runnable unit and description. They can be application services themselves, such as stateless web services, or services relied upon by the application, like Redis. Components encapsulate the basic capabilities required by applications, such as computing, networking, etc., and are reusable modules. Through components, application developers can quickly create applications and engage in application development.

## Overview of Built-in Components

      <th>Built-in Component Name</th>
      <th>Applicable Scenarios</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Web Service</b></td>
      <td>Applicable for defining persistent, scalable stateless containerized services.</td>

      <td><b>Stateful Service</b></td>
      <td>Applicable for defining persistent stateful containerized services that need to save data.</td>

### Web Service

This component encompasses Kubernetes' Deployment and Service, used for defining persistent, scalable stateless containerized services, and supports internal and external network access. For example, you can use this component to create an Nginx service.

### Stateful Service

This component includes Kubernetes' StatefulSet and Service, used for defining persistent stateful containerized services that need to save data. For example, you can use this component to create a database.

If the container runs on the host, the empty directory will persist; if the container is removed from the host, the empty directory will be deleted, resulting in data loss. An empty directory facilitates file sharing among containers running in the same pod and supports a single container temporarily writing data on disk.</li></ul></td>
