# Resource Quota

Refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: [Resource Quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)

## Understanding Resource Requests & Limits

Used to restrict resources available to a specific namespace. The total resource usage by all Pods in the namespace (excluding those in a `Terminating` state) must not exceed the quota.

**Resource Requests**: Define the minimum resources (e.g., CPU, memory) required by a container, guiding the Kubernetes Scheduler to place the Pod on a node with sufficient capacity.

**Resource Limits**: Define the maximum resources a container can consume, preventing resource exhaustion and ensuring cluster stability.

## Quotas

### Resource Quotas
> If a resource is marked as `Unlimited`, no explicit quota is enforced, but usage cannot exceed the cluster's available capacity.

Resource Quotas track the cumulative resource consumption (e.g., container limits, new Pods, or PVCs) within a namespace.

**Supported Quota Types**

| Field           | Description                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Resource Requests**           | Total requested resources for all Pods in the namespace:<ul><li>CPU</li><li>Memory</li></ul>    |
| **Resource Limits**             | Total limit resources for all Pods in the namespace:<ul><li>CPU</li><li>Memory</li></ul>  |
| **Number of Pods**              | Maximum number of Pods allowed in the namespace. |

Note:
- Namespace quotas are derived from the project's allocated cluster resources. If any resource's available quota is 0, namespace creation will fail. Contact the administrator.
- `Unlimited` implies the namespace can consume the project's remaining cluster resources for that resource type.

#### YAML file example
```yaml
# example-resourcequota.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: example-resourcequota
  namespace: <example>
spec:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "20"
    limits.memory: 20Gi
    pods: "500"
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: 2Gi

```
#### Create resouce quota by using CLI
**Create via YAML file**

```bash
kubectl apply -f example-resourcequota.yaml
```

**Create via command line directly**

```bash
kubectl create resourcequota example-resourcequota --namespace=<example> --hard=limits.cpu=20,limits.memory=20Gi,pods=500
```

### Storage Quotas

**Quota Type**:
- **All**: Total PVC storage capacity in the namespace.
- **Storage Class**: Total PVC storage capacity for a specific storage class.

**Note**: Ensure the storage class is pre-assigned to the project containing the namespace.

##  Hardware accelerator Resources Quotas \{#extended-resources-quotas}

When `Alauda Build of Hami` or `NVIDIA GPU Device Plugin` installed, you will be able to use extended resources quotas about hardware accelerator.

Refer to [Alauda Build of Hami](../../../hardware_accelerator/hami.mdx) and [Alauda Build of NVIDIA GPU Device Plugin](../../../hardware_accelerator/pgpu.mdx).

### Other Quotas

The format for custom quota names must comply with the following specifications:

- If the custom quota name does not contain a slash (/): It must start and end with a letter or number, and can contain letters, numbers, hyphens (-), underscores (_), or periods (.), forming a qualified name with a maximum length of 63 characters.
- If the custom quota name contains a slash (/): The name is divided into two parts: prefix and name, in the form of: prefix/name. The prefix must be a valid DNS subdomain, while the name must comply with the rules for a qualified name.
- DNS Subdomain:
  - Label: Must start and end with lowercase letters or numbers, may contain hyphens (-), but cannot be exclusively composed of hyphens, with a maximum length of 63 characters.
  - Subdomain: Extends the rules of the label, allowing multiple labels to be connected by periods (.) to form a subdomain, with a maximum length of 253 characters.
