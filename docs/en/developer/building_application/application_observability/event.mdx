# Events

Event information generated by Kubernetes resource state changes and operational status updates, with integrated visual query interface.When applications, workloads, or other resources encounter exceptions, real-time event analysis helps troubleshoot root causes.

## Procedure

> This procedure demonstrates how to view container runtime evens through the Deployment interface.

1. **Container Platform**, click **Workloads** > **Deployments**.

2. Click a Deployment name from the list.

3. Navigate to the **Events** tab to view detailed records.

## Event records interpretation

**Resource event records**: Below the event summary panel, all matching events within the specified time range are listed. Click event cards to view complete event details. Each card displays:

  - **Resource Type**: Kubernetes resource type represented by icon abbreviations:
    - `P` = Pod
    - `RS` = ReplicaSet
    - `D` = Deployment
    - `SVC` = Service

  - **Resource Name**: Target resource named.

  - **Event Reason**: Kubernetes-reported reason (e.g., FailedScheduling).

  - **Event Level**: Event severity.
    - `Normal` : Informational
    - `Warning` : Requires immediate attention

  - **Time**: Last Occurrence time, Occurrence Count.

:::info
Kubernetes allows administrators to configure event retention periods through the Event TTL controller with a default retention period of 1 hour. Expired events are automatically purged by the system. For comprehensive historical records, access the [All Events](../../../observability/event/event.mdx).
