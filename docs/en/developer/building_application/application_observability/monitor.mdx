# Monitoring Dashboards

- Supports viewing resource monitoring data for workload components on the platform for the past 7 days (with configurable monitoring data retention period). Includes statistics for applications, workloads, pods, and trends/rankings of CPU/memory usage. 
- Supports Namespace-Level monitoring.
- Supported Workload-Level Monitoring: **Applications**, **Deployments**, **DaemonSets**, **StatefulSets**, and **Pods**

## Prerequisites
- [Installation of Monitoring Plugins](../../../../observability/monitor/install_monitor.mdx)

## Namespace-Level Monitoring Dashboards

### Procedure

1. **Container Platform**, click **Observe** > **Dashboards**.

2. View monitoring data under the namespace. Three dashboards are provided: **Applications Overview**, **Workloads Overview**, and **Pods Overview**.

3. Switch between dashboards to monitor target **Overview**. 

### Creating Namespace-Level Monitoring Dashboard

1. **Administrator**, create a dedicated monitoring dashboard by referring to [Creating Monitoring Dashboard](../../../../observability/monitor/functions/manage_dashboard.mdx#｛#create_dashboard｝) to create a dedicated monitoring dashboard.
2. Configure the following labels to display the Namespace-Level Monitoring dashboard on the **Container Platform**:
   - `cpaas.io/dashboard.folder: container-platform`
   - `cpaas.io/dashboard.tag.overview: "true"`

## Workload-Level Monitoring 
> This procedure demonstrates how to view pod monitoring through the Deployment interface.

### Default Monitoring Dashboard
#### Procedure

1. **Container Platform**, click **Workloads** > **Deployments**.

2. Click a Deployment name from the list.

3. Navigate to the **Monitoring** tab to view default monitoring metrics.

#### Metric interpretation

| **Monitoring Resource** | **Metric Granularity** | **Technical Definition** |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **CPU**             | **Utilization**/**Usage** | **Utilization** = Usage/Limit (limits)<br/>Assess container limit configuration. High utilization indicates insufficient limits.<br/>**Usage** represents actual resource consumption.|
| **Memory**          | **Utilization**/**Usage** | **Utilization** = Usage/Limit (limits)<br />Evaluation method same as CPU. High rate may cause component instability.|
| **Network Traffic** | **Inflow Rate**/**Outflow Rate** | Network traffic (bytes/sec) flowing into/out of pods.   |
| **Network Packet** | **Receiving Rate**/**Transmit Rate** | Network packets (count/sec) received/sent by pods.   |
| **Disk Rate**      | **Read**/**Write** | Read/write throughput (bytes/sec) of mounted volumes per workload.          |
| **Disk IOPS**      | **Read**/**Write** | Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) of mounted volumes per workload.  |

### Custom Monitoring Dashboard
4. Click the **Toggle Icon** to switch to custom dashboards. Refer to [Add Pannel in Custom Dashboard](../../../../observability/monitor/functions/manage_dashboard.mdx) to create dedicated **Workload-Level** monitoring dashboard.
