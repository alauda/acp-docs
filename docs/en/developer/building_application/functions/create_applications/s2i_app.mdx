# Creating applications from Code

Creating application from code is implemented using Source to Image(S2I) technology. S2I is an automated framework for building container images directly from source code. This approach standardizes and automates the application build process, allowing developers to focus on source code development without worrying about containerization details.

## Prerequisites
- Complete the installation of [ACP Builds](../../../s2i/install_builds/install_builds_opeator.mdx)

## Operating Steps

1. **Container Platform**， and navigate to **Application** > **Applications**.

2. Click **Create**.

3. Select the **Create from Code**.

4. For detailed parameter descriptions, please refer to [Managing applications created from Code](/developer/s2i/functions/s2i_application_management.mdx#s2iparameter)

5. After completing the parameter input, click **Create**.

6. The corresponding deployment can be viewed on the **Detail Information** page.
