# Creating applications by using Chart

Based on Helm Chart represents a native application deployment pattern. A Helm Chart is a collection of files that define Kubernetes resources, designed to package applications and facilitate application distribution with version control capabilities. This enables seamless environment transitions, such as migrations from development to production environments.

## Precautions

When a cluster contains both Linux and Windows nodes, explicit node selection MUST be configured to prevent scheduling conflicts. Example:

```
spec:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/os: linux
```

## Prerequisites
If the template is from a application and references relevant resources (e.g., secret dictionaries), ensure the to-be-referenced resources already exist in the current namespace before application deployment.

## Procedure

1. **Container Platform**, navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** in the left sidebar. 

2. Click **Create**.

3. Choose **Create from Catalog** as the creation approach.  

4. Select a Chart and configure parameters, pick a Chart and configure the required parameters, such as `resources.requests`, `resources.limits`, and other parameters that are closely related to the chart.

5. Click **Create**. 

The web console will redirect you to the **Application** > [**Native Applications**] details page. The process will take some time, so please be patient. In case of operation failure, follow the interface prompts to complete the operation.

## Status Analysis Reference

Click on ***Application Name*** to display detailed status analysis of the Chart in the details information.

| **Type** | **Reason** |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------|
| **Initialized** | Indicates the status of Chart template download. <ul><li>**True**: It indicates that the Chart template has been successfully downloaded.</li><li>**False**: It indicates that the Chart template download has failed; you can check the specific failure reason in the message column.</li><ul><li>`ChartLoadFailed`: Chart template download failed.</li><li>`InitializeFailed`: There was an exception in the initialization process before the Chart was downloaded.</li></ul></ul>|
| **Validated**   | Indicates the status of user permissions, dependencies, and other validations for the Chart template. <ul><li>**True**: It indicates that all validation checks have passed.</li><li>**False**: It indicates that there are validation checks that have not passed; you can check the specific failure reason in the message column.</li><ul><li>`DependenciesCheckFailed`: Chart dependency check failed.</li><li>`PermissionCheckFailed`: The current user lacks permission to perform operations on certain resources.</li><li>`ConsistentNamespaceCheckFailed`: When deploying applications through templates in native applications, the Chart contains resources that require cross-namespace deployment.</li></ul></ul> |
| **Synced**      | Indicates the deployment status of the Chart template. <ul><li>**True**: It indicates that the Chart template has been successfully deployed.</li><li>**False**: It indicates that the Chart template deployment has failed; the reason column shows `ChartSyncFailed`, and you can check the specific failure reason in the message column.</li></ul> |

:::warning
- If the template references cross - namespace resources, contact the Administrator for help with creation. Afterward, you can normally [Updating and deleting Chart Applications](../application_operation/chart_upgrade.mdx) on web console.
- If the template references cluster - level resources (e.g., StorageClasses), it's recommended to contact the Administrator for assistance with creation.
