# Create Native Applications with Helm Chart

Deploy native applications based on application templates (Helm Charts). The application template is a collection of files that describe Kubernetes-related resources, typically used to encapsulate applications and meet requirements for application distribution and version management, such as transitioning from development to production environments.

## Precautions

If the cluster contains both Linux and Windows nodes, to prevent applications from being scheduled on incompatible nodes, host selection must be configured. For example:

```
spec:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/os: linux
```

## Usage Restrictions

- If the template references cross-namespace resources, please contact the administrator for assistance with deployment on the platform management team. You can then normally update or delete [template applications](../application_operation/chart_upgrade.mdx) on the platform.

- If the template references cluster-level resources (e.g., storage classes), it is recommended to contact the administrator for assistance with deployment on the platform management team.

## Prerequisites

If the template originates from a native application and the native application references relevant resources (e.g., secret dictionaries), ensure that the resources to be referenced already exist in the current namespace before deploying the application.

## Steps

1. Enter **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click **Create Native Application**.

4. Select the **Template Deployment** method.

5. In the left navigation bar, click **Helm chart**.

6. Click the **Deploy** button on the Chart card.

7. Fill in the relevant parameters, such as `resources.requests`, `resources.limits`, and other parameters closely related to the business.

8. Click **Deploy**. The platform will redirect you to **Application Management** > **[Native Applications]** page.

   Deployment will take some time, please be patient. If the operation fails, please complete the operation according to the prompts on the interface.

## Status Analysis Explanation

Click on ***Native Application Name*** to display detailed deployment status analysis of the Chart in the details information.
