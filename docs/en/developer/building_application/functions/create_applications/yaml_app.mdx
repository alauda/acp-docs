# Create application from YAML

If you are familiar with YAML syntax and wish to use configurations that are not defined in forms or templates, you can choose the one-click YAML creation method, which allows for more flexible configuration of the basic information and resources for your native application.

## Precautions

If both Linux and Windows nodes are present in the cluster, to avoid scheduling the application on incompatible nodes, host selection must be configured. For example:

```yaml
spec:
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/os: linux
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the images defined in the YAML can be pulled in the current cluster: use the `docker pull` command to verify.

## Steps

1. Access **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click **Create Native Application**.

4. Select the **One-click YAML Creation** method.

5. Complete the configuration and click **OK**.
