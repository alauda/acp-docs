# Creating OAM Applications

## Creating OAM Applications via Form

### Prerequisites

Obtain the image address. The image sources include image repositories integrated by the platform administrator through the toolchain or third-party platform image repositories.

- For the former, the platform administrator will usually assign the image repository to your project, from which you can use the images. If the required image repository is not found, please contact the platform administrator for assignment.

- If it is a third-party platform's image repository, ensure that the images can be pulled directly from it in the current cluster.

### Steps to Operate

1. Navigate to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **OAM Applications**.

3. Click **Create Application**.

4. Choose **Form Creation**.

5. Fill in the application name and set labels or annotations.

   | Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
   |-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Labels**  | Used to select objects and find sets of objects that meet certain criteria. Must be a key-value pair, for example *app.kubernetes.io/name: hello-app*.                                                                                      |
   | **Annotations** | Used to provide any information to development and operations teams. Must be a key-value pair, for example: *cpaas.io/maintainer: kim*. <br />**Note**: If the annotation value is a clickable link, set the key as `app.{display text}.url` to enable navigation through the display text in the interface, for example *app.Docs.url: [https://example.com/docs/](https://example.com/docs/)*. |

6. Click **Add Component**.

7. Select a type of component and click **Next**.

8. Continue configuring attributes, adding operational traits, and other operations.

   - [Description of Preset Component Attributes](/developer/oam_applications/concepts/component.mdx)

   - [Description of Preset Operational Traits](/developer/oam_applications/concepts/trait.mdx)

   - [Import Custom Components](/developer/oam_applications/how_to/component_style.mdx)

   - [Import Custom Operational Traits](/developer/oam_applications/how_to/component_style.mdx)

   **Note**: You can configure operational traits immediately or wait until the environment is ready before configuring.

## Creating OAM Applications via YAML

If you are proficient at creating applications or wish to quickly migrate applications within the cluster, you can use a YAML file to complete the required component and operational trait configuration with one click. In addition to the YAML samples provided by the platform, you can also visit the [OAM Open Source Community](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/blob/master/7.application.md) for further guidance on writing application YAML.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that the images defined in the YAML can be pulled in the current cluster: execute the `docker pull` command to verify.

### Usage Restrictions

If the YAML file is exported from an existing OAM application, be sure to modify the application and component names in the YAML to avoid duplicate names in the same namespace.

### Steps to Operate

1. Navigate to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **OAM Applications**.

3. Click **Create Application**.

4. Choose **YAML One-Click Creation**.

5. Fill in the YAML content and click **Create**.

   After creation, you can update the application or component normally through the UI.
