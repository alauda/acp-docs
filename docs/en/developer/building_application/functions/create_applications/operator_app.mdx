# Creating Component Applications through Operator

Operator backed applications are collections of resources provided by the Operator. Based on these Operator backed applications, you can quickly deploy a component application and leverage the capabilities of the Operator to automate the entire lifecycle management of the application.

## Steps

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Operator backed**.

3. Click on **Deploy** on the Operator card.

4. Fill in the relevant parameters, such as `Resource Quota`.

5. Click on **Deploy**. The platform will redirect to **Application Management** > **Component Applications** page.

   Deployment will take some time, please be patient. If the operation fails, please follow the prompts on the interface to complete the operation.
