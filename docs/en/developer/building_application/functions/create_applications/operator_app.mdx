# Creating applications by using Operator Backed

Operator backed applications are collections of resources provided by the Operator. Based on these Operator backed applications, you can quickly deploy a component application and leverage the capabilities of the Operator to automate the entire lifecycle management of the application.

## Procedure

1. **Container Platform**, navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** in the left sidebar. 

2. Click **Create**.

3. Choose **Create from Catalog** as the creation approach.  

4. Select an Operator-Backed Instance and Configure **Custom Resource Parameters**. Select an Operator-managed application instance and configure its Custom Resource (CR) specifications in the CR manifest, including: 
   - `spec.resources.limits` (container-level resource constraints).
   - `spec.resourceQuota` (Operator-defined quota policies). Other CR-specific parameters such as `spec.replicas`, `spec.storage.className`, etc.

5. Click **Create**. 

The web console will navigate to **Applications** > **Operator Backed Apps** page.

**Note**: 
The Kubernetes resource creation process requires asynchronous reconciliation. Completion may take several minutes depending on cluster conditions.

## Troubleshooting

If resource creation fails:  
1. Inspect controller reconciliation errors:  
   ```bash
   kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.kind=<Your-Custom-Resource> --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
   ```
2. Verify API resource availability:
   ```bash
   kubectl api-resources | grep <Your-Resource-Type>
   ```
3. Retry creation after verifying CRD/Operator readiness:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f your-resource-manifest.yaml
   ```
