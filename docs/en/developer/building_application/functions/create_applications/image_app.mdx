# Create application from Images

## Prerequisites

Obtain the image address. The source of the images can be from the image repository integrated by the platform administrator through the toolchain or from third-party platforms' image repositories.

- For the former, the platform administrator typically assigns the image repository to your project, and you can use the images within it. If the required image repository is not found, please contact the platform administrator for allocation.

- If it is a third-party platform's image repository, ensure that images can be pulled directly from it in the current cluster.

## Operating Steps

1. Go to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click **Create**.

4. Select **Create via Image**.

5. Choose an image and click **OK**.

   **Note**: You can filter images by selecting only if using images from the integrated image repository of this platform. Here, the integrated project name, for example, *containers (docker-registry-projectname)*, includes the project name *projectname* in this platform and the project name *containers* in the image repository.

6. Refer to the following instructions to configure the related parameters.

   | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Compute Component | Select the deployment mode as needed: <ul><li>**Deployment**: For specific parameter descriptions, please refer to [Create Deployment](../application_workloads/deployment_create.mdx).</li><li>**DaemonSet**: For specific parameter descriptions, please refer to [DaemonSet](../application_workloads/deamonset_create.mdx).</li><li>**StatefulSet**: For specific parameter descriptions, please refer to [StatefulSet](../application_workloads/statefulset_create.mdx).</li></ul>                              |
   | Internal Routing | Internal routing refers to Kubernetes Service, which enables service discovery within the compute components. Internal routing, combined with ingress rules (Kubernetes Ingress) or load balancing port forwarding rules, can distribute external traffic to the Pods of backend services in the platform, thus providing service discovery capabilities for the compute components. For specific parameter descriptions, please refer to [Create Internal Routing](/developer/building_application/functions/operation_after_creating/network_communications/service/create_service.mdx).<br /><br />**Note**: The default name prefix for the internal routing created under the application is the name of the compute component. If the compute component type (deployment mode) is StatefulSet, it is advisable not to change the default name of the internal routing (the name of the compute component); otherwise, it may lead to accessibility issues for the compute component. |
   | Ingress Rules | Ingress rules utilize Kubernetes Ingress to expose HTTP/HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to the internal Kubernetes Service, achieving control over external access to the compute components. For specific parameter descriptions, please refer to [Create Ingress Rules](/developer/building_application/functions/operation_after_creating/network_communications/ingress/create_ingress.mdx).<br /><br />**Note**: The internal routing used when creating ingress rules under the application must be resources under the current application. However, ensure that the internal routing is associated with the compute components under the application; otherwise, service discovery and access for the compute components under the application will not be possible. |

7. Click **Create**.

| **Update** | <ul><li>By default, after changing the compute component configuration, only **the specific compute component** is updated based on the [update policy](../application_workloads/deployment_create.mdx#updatepolicy) (taking deployments as an example). If force updating the application, **all compute components** will be updated according to their own update policies.</li><li>You should be cautious when checking the **force update** option. Although force updating the application can efficiently restart compute components in batches (for instance, when configuration dictionaries are modified and many compute components in the application reference them as environment variables), it is not recommended to use force updates in most scenarios, as it might affect cluster performance and application availability.</li><li><b>Additional Notes on External Cluster Access:</b><ul><li>If the ingress rules are deleted, if the internal routing of the load balancer listens to the default ports, or if the routing rules being listened to use internal routing under the current application, external traffic can still access the application through `load balancer address/domain + listening port`.</li><li>If the internal routing is deleted, although the reference relationship with the ingress rules remains unchanged, external traffic can no longer access the application.</li></ul></li></ul> |
| **Delete** | Deleting the application will also delete all associated resources under the application, such as internal routing. |
