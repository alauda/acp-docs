# Exporting Native Applications

To standardize the export process of applications between development, testing, and production environments, and to facilitate the rapid migration of business to new environments, you can export native applications as application templates (Charts) or export simplified YAML files that can be used directly for deployment. This allows the native application to run in different environments or namespaces. You can also export YAML files to a code repository to deploy applications across clusters quickly using GitOps functionality.

## Exporting Helm Charts

### Steps

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click on the ***application name*** of the type `Custom Application`.

4. Click on **Actions** > **Export**; you can also export a specific version from the application detail page.

5. Choose one export method as needed and refer to the following instructions to configure the relevant information.

   - Exporting Helm Charts to a template repository with management permissions

     **Note**: The template repository is added by the platform administrator. Please contact the platform administrator to obtain a valid template repository of type **Chart** or **OCI Chart** with **Management** permissions.

     | Parameter         | Description                                                                                     |
     | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | **Target Location**   | Select **Template Repository** to directly sync the template to a template repository of type **Chart** or **OCI Chart** with **Management** permissions. The project owner assigned to this **Template Repository** can directly use the template. |
     | **Template Directory** | When the selected template repository type is OCI Chart, you need to select or manually input the directory for storing the Helm Chart.<br />**Note**: When manually entering a new template directory, the platform will create this directory in the template repository, but there is a risk of the creation failing.   |
     | **Version**     | The version number of the application template.<br />The format should be `v<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>`. The default value is the current application version or the current snapshot version. |
     | **Icon**       | Supports JPG, PNG, and GIF image formats, with a file size of no more than 500KB. Suggested dimensions are 80\*60 pixels.                                     |
     | **Description** | The description will be displayed in the list of application templates within the application directory.                      |
     | **README**     | Description file. Supports editing in Markdown format and will be displayed on the details page of the application template.            |
     | **NOTES**      | Template help file. Supports standard plaintext editing; after the deployment template is completed, it will be displayed on the template application details page. |

   - Exporting Helm Charts to local for manual upload to the template repository: Select **Local** as the target location and choose **Helm Chart** as the file format to generate a Helm Chart package which will be downloaded locally for offline transmission.

6. Click **Export**.

### Follow-Up Actions

- If you export the Helm Chart to local, you will need to [add the template to a template repository with management permissions](../helm_chart/manage_helmchart.mdx).

- Regardless of the export method chosen, you can refer to [Creating Native Applications - Template Method](../create_applications/chart_app.mdx) to create a `Template Application` type of native application in a **non-current** namespace.

## Exporting YAML to Local

### Steps

#### **Method 1**

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click on ***application name***.

4. Click on **Actions** > **Export**; you can also export a specific version from the application detail page.

5. Select **Local** as the target location and **YAML** as the file format, at which point you can export a simplified YAML file that can be deployed directly in other environments.

6. Click **Export**.

#### **Method 2**

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click on ***application name***.

4. Click on the **YAML** tab, configure settings as needed, and preview the YAML file.

   | Type            | Description                                                                                                                |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Full YAML**    | By default, **Preview Simplified YAML** is not selected, displaying the YAML file with the **managedFields fields hidden**. You can preview it and export directly; you may also uncheck **Hide managedFields fields** to export the full YAML file.<br />**Note**: Full YAML is primarily used for operations and troubleshooting and cannot be used to quickly create native applications on the platform. |
   | **Simplified YAML** | Check **Preview Simplified YAML**, at which point you can preview and export a simplified YAML file that can be deployed directly in other environments. |

5. Click **Export**.

### Follow-Up Actions

After exporting the simplified YAML, you can refer to [Creating Native Applications - YAML Method](../create_applications/yaml_app.mdx) to create a `Custom Application` type of native application in a **non-current** namespace.

## Exporting YAML to Code Repository (Alpha)

### Precautions

- Only platform administrators and project administrators can directly export native application YAML files to the code repository.

- `Template Applications` do not support exporting Kustomize formatted application configuration files or directly exporting YAML files to the code repository; you can first **detach from the template** and convert it to a `Custom Application`.

### Steps

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click on the ***application name*** of type `Custom`.

4. Click on **Actions** > **Export**; you can also export a specific version from the application detail page.

5. Choose one export method as needed and refer to the following instructions to configure the relevant information.

   - Exporting Kustomize-type files to local for manual upload to the code repository: Select **Local** as the target location and choose **Kustomize** as the file format to export the Kustomize-type application configuration file locally. This file supports differentiated configurations and is suitable for cross-cluster application deployments.

6. Click **Export**.

### Follow-Up Actions

After exporting the YAML to a Git code repository, you can refer to [Creating GitOps Applications](/gitops/functions/create_argocd_application/create_application_via_platform.mdx) to create a `Custom Application` type of GitOps application across clusters.
