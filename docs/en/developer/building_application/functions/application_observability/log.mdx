# Logs

Aggregate container runtime logs with visual query capabilities. When applications, workloads, or other resources exhibit abnormal behavior, log analysis helps diagnose root causes.

## Procedure

> This procedure demonstrates how to view container runtime logs through the Deployment interface.

1. **Container Platform**, click **Workloads** > **Deployments**.

2. Click a Deployment name from the list.

3. Navigate to the **Logs** tab to view detailed records.

   | Operation | Description                                                              |
   | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Pod**/**Container** | Switch between Pods and Containers using the dropdown selector to view the corresponding logs.           |
   | **Previous Logs** | View logs from terminated containers (available when container restartCount > 0).                |
   | **Lines**     | Configure display log buffer size: 1K/10K/100K lines.      |
   | **Wrap Line** | Toggle line wrapping for long log entries (enabled by default). |
   | **Find**     | Full-text search with highlight matching and Enter-to-navigate.  |
   | **Raw**      |Unprocessed log streams directly captured from container runtime interfaces (CRI) without formatting, filtering, or truncation.|
   |**Export**| Download raw logs.|
   |**Full Screen**| Click truncated line to view full content in modal dialog.|

:::warning
- **Truncation Handling**: Log entries exceeding 2000 characters will be truncated with an ellipsis `...`
   - Trimmed portions cannot be matched by the page's find function.
   - Click the ellipsis `...` marker in truncated lines to view full content in a modal dialog. 
- **Copy Reliability**: Avoid direct copying from rendered log viewer when seeing truncation markers (...) or ANSI color codes. Always use **Export**, **Raw** function for complete logs.
- **Retention Policy**: Live logs follow Kubernetes log rotation configuration. For historical analysis, use [Logs](../../../../observability/log/functions/log.mdx) under Observe.
