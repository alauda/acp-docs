# Manage Namespace Users

## Import Members

The platform supports bulk importing members into a namespace and assigning roles such as Namespace Administrator or Developer to grant corresponding permissions.

### Constraints and Limitations

- Members can only be imported into the namespace from the **Project Members** of the namespace’s project.

- The platform does not support importing default system-created admin users or the active user.

### Prerequisites

To import users as namespace members, they must first be added to the namespace’s project.

### Procedure

1. **Project Management**, click on ***Project Name*** where the members to be imported are located.

2. Navigation to **Namespaces** > **Namespaces**.

3. Click on ***Namespace Name*** of the members to be imported.

4. In the **Namespace Members** tab, click **Import Members**.

5. Follow the procedures below to import all or some users from the list into the namespace.

   :::tip
   You can select a user group using the dropdown box at the top right of the dialog and perform a fuzzy search by entering the username in the username search box.

   - Import all users in the list as namespace members and assign roles to users in bulk.

     1. Click the dropdown on the right side of the **Set Role** item at the bottom of the dialog, and select the role name to assign.

     2. Click **Import All**.

   - Import one or more users from the list as namespace members.

     1. Click the checkbox in front of the username/display name to select one or more users.

     2. Click the dropdown on the right side of the **Set Role** item at the bottom of the dialog, and select the role name to assign to the selected users.

     3. Click **Import**.

## Add Members

When the platform has added an OICD type IDP, OIDC users can be added as namespace members.

You can add valid OIDC accounts that meet the input requirements as namespace roles and assign the corresponding namespace roles to the user.

**Note**: When adding members, the system does not verify the validity of the accounts. Please ensure that the accounts you add are valid; otherwise, these accounts will not be able to log in to the platform successfully.

**Valid OIDC accounts include**: Valid accounts in the OIDC identity authentication service configured via IDP for the platform, including those that have successfully logged in to the platform and those that have not logged in to the platform.

**Prerequisites**

The platform has added an **OICD** type IDP.

### Procedure

1. **Project Management**, click on ***Project Name*** where the member to be added is located.

2. Navigation to **Namespaces** > **Namespaces**.

3. Click on ***Namespace Name*** of the member to be added.

4. In the **Namespace Members** tab, click **Add Member**.

5. In the **Username** input box, enter a username for an existing third-party platform account supported by the platform.

   **Note**: Please confirm that the entered username corresponds to an existing account on the third-party platform; otherwise, that account will not be able to log in to this platform successfully.

6. In the **Role** dropdown, select the role name to configure for this user.

7. Click **Add**.  
   After a successful addition, you can view the member in the namespace member list.  
   At the same time, in the user list (**Platform Management > User Management**), you can view that user. Before the user successfully logs in or is synchronized to this platform, the source will be `-`, and it can be deleted; when the account successfully logs in or synchronizes to the platform, the platform will record the account's source information and display it in the user list.

## Remove Members

Remove specified namespace members and delete their associated roles to revoke their namespace permissions.

### Procedure

1. **Project Management**, click on ***Project Name*** where the member to be removed is located.

2. Navigation to **Namespaces** > **Namespaces**.

3. Click on ***Namespace Name*** of the member to be removed.

4. In the **Namespace Members** tab, click ⋮ on the right side of the record of the member to be removed > **Remove**.

5. Click **Remove**.
