# Importing Namespaces

## Prerequisites
- The Namespace is not currently managed by any existing Project within the platform.
- Namespaces can only be imported into a Project that is already associated with their target Kubernetes Cluster. If no such Project exists, you must first provision a Project linked to that Cluster.

## Overview

**Namespace Lifecycle Management Capabilities**:

- Cross-Cluster Namespace Import: Importing Namespaces into a Project centralizes their management across all Kubernetes Clusters provisioned by the platform. This provides administrators with unified resource governance and monitoring capabilities across distributed environments.

**Namespace Disassociation**: 
- The Disassociate Namespace feature enables you to unlink a Namespace from its current Project, resetting its association for subsequent reassignment or cleanup.

- Importing a Namespace into a Project grants it capabilities equivalent to those of natively created Namespaces on the platform. This includes inherited Project-level Policies (e.g., Resource Quotas), unified monitoring, and centralized governance controls.

**Important Notes**:

- A Namespace can only be associated with one Project at any given time.
- If a Namespace is already linked to a Project, it cannot be imported into or reassigned to another Project without first disassociating it from its original Project.

## Use Cases

Common use cases for **Namespace** management include:

- Upon connecting a new **Kubernetes cluster** to the platform, you can utilize the **Import Namespace** feature to associate its existing **Kubernetes Namespaces** with a Project. Simply select the target Project and Cluster to initiate the import. This action grants the **project** governance over these **namespace**, encompassing **Resource Quotas**, monitoring, and policy enforcement.

- A **namespace** that has been disassociated from one **project** can be seamlessly re-associated with another project via the **Import Namespace** feature for continued centralized governance.

- Namespaces not currently managed by any **project** (e.g., those created via cluster-level scripts) must be linked to a target **project** using the **Import Namespace** feature to enable platform-level governance, including visibility and centralized management.

## Procedure
1. **Project Management**, click on the ***Project name*** where the namespace is to be imported.
2. Navigate to **Namespaces** > **Namespaces**.
3. Click on the **Dropdown** button next to **Create Namespace**, then select **Import Namespace**.
4. Refer to the [Creating Namespaces](./create_namespace.mdx) documentation for parameter configuration details.
5. Click **Import**.
