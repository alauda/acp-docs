# Import Namespaces

## Prerequisites

- The namespace is not associated with any project on the platform.

- Namespaces can only be imported into projects linked to their target cluster. If no projects exist in the platform linked to the target cluster, you must first create a project associated with that cluster.

## Overview

**Namespace Management Capabilities**:
- **Cross-Cluster Namespace Import**
  - Importing namespaces into a project enables centralized management of Kubernetes namespaces across all clusters provisioned on the platform. This allows administrators to unify resource governance and monitoring across distributed environments.

- **Namespace Disassociation**
  - The Disassociate Namespace feature allows you to unlink a namespace from its current project, resetting its association for reassignment or cleanup.

Importing a namespace into the project grants it equivalent capabilities to namespaces natively created on the platform. This includes access to project-level policies (e.g., resource quotas), unified monitoring, and governance controls.

**Note**:
- A namespace can only be associated with one project at any time.
- If a namespace is already linked to a project, it cannot be imported into or reassigned to another project without first disassociating it from the original project.

## Use Cases

Common use cases include:

- After connecting a new cluster to the platform, you can associate its existing Kubernetes namespaces with a project via the Namespace Import feature.Select the target project and cluster to import namespaces.This action grants the project governance over the namespaces, including resource quotas, monitoring, and policy enforcement.

- A namespace disassociated from a project can be re-associated with another project via the Namespace Import feature for centralized governance.

- Namespaces not associated with any project (e.g., created via cluster-level scripts) must be linked to a target project via the Namespace Import feature to enable platform-level governance, including visibility and centralized management.

## Procedure

1. In the **Project Management** view, click on the ***Project Name*** where the namespace to be imported is located.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Namespaces** > **Namespaces**.

3. Click the **Dropdown** button next to **Create Namespace**, then click **Import Namespace**.

4. Refer to the [Create Namespace](./create_namespace.mdx) parameter description to configure the relevant parameters.

5. Click **Import**.
