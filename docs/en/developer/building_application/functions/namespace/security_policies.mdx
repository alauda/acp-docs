# Pod Security Policies

Refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: [Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/)

**Pod Security Policies** can restrict which privileges or features the containers in a pod can use, as well as regulate how the containers in a pod operate. The platform implements a more granular pod security policy based on **Pod Security Admission (PSA)**. It defines three security modes and security standards:

- **Security Modes**: The security mode in Kubernetes is a mechanism to control security policies, used to define how Kubernetes handles pods that violate security policies. For more details, please refer to the official documentation. The security modes can be classified into the following three:

  - **Enforce Mode**: If a pod violates the security policy, Kubernetes will reject the creation or modification of the pod and return an error message. This mode is suitable for production environments with high-security requirements.

  - **Audit Mode**: When a pod violates the security policy, Kubernetes will log the event and store the record in the audit log. This mode is typically used to understand security incidents in the cluster for subsequent investigation and analysis.

  - **Warn Mode**: If a pod violates the security policy, Kubernetes will allow the creation or modification of the pod and return a warning message. This mode is typically used in testing or transitional periods so that administrators can gradually adjust security policies without impacting applications.

- **Security Standards**: Pod security standards define three different policies to broadly cover security application scenarios. For more details, please refer to the official documentation.

  - **Privileged Standard**: Containers in the pod have privileged access, allowing all operations without any restrictions.

  - **Baseline Standard**: Restricts containers in the pod from using host namespaces, networks, file systems, processes, etc. This is a default security standard that typically applies to most scenarios.

  - **Restricted Standard**: Further restricts containers in the pod from using host resources, including limiting container access to file systems, networks, etc. This is a highly secure standard suited for scenarios with very high security requirements. These security standards can be verified against pods using the Admission Controller in Kubernetes to ensure that containers in the pod do not compromise the security of the Kubernetes cluster.
