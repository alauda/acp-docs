# Deleting/Removing Namespaces

**Namespace Operations**:

You can either delete a namespace permanently or remove it from the current project.

**Delete Namespace**: Permanently deletes the namespace and all its associated resources (e.g., workloads, services), freeing up allocated quotas. This action is irreversible.

**Remove Namespace**: Remove a namespace from the project without affecting its cluster-level resources, including applications, persistent volumes, configurations, etc.

The removed namespace can be imported into other projects linked to its target cluster via the **Namespace Import** feature. For details [Import Namespace](./import_namespace.mdx).
