# Configure VPA

Whether for stateless or stateful applications, the VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) supports recommending more appropriate CPU and memory resource limits based on your business needs, assisting you in configuring pod resources while ensuring that pods have sufficient resources to improve cluster resource utilization.

## Prerequisites

- Please ensure that the current cluster has deployed monitoring components, and that the monitoring components are running properly. You can check the deployment and health status of monitoring components by clicking on the upper right corner of the platform <span style={{ display: 'inline-flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '4px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}><img src="./assets/question.png" alt="expand" style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> <span>  > **Platform Health Status**, to view the deployment and health of the monitoring components.</span></span>.
- Please ensure that the administrator has deployed the **Vertical Autoscaling** plugin for the current cluster.

## Steps to Operate

1. In the left navigation bar, click on **Workloads** > **Deployments**.

2. Click on ***Deployment Name***.

3. Scroll down to the **Elastic Scaling** area and click **Update** on the right.

4. Select **Vertical Scaling** and configure the scaling rules.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                   |
   | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Scaling Mode** | Currently supports **Manual Scaling** mode, which provides recommended resource configurations by analyzing past resource usage. You can manually adjust according to the recommended values. Adjustments will cause pods to be recreated and restarted, so please choose an appropriate time to avoid impacting running applications.<br />Typically, after pods have been running for more than 8 days, the recommended values will become accurate. |
   | **Target Container** | Defaults to the first container of the workload. You can choose to enable resource limit recommendations for one or more containers as needed.                                                                                       |

5. Click **Update**.

## Follow-Up Actions

After configuring, the recommended values for CPU and memory resource limits of the target container can be viewed in the **Elastic Scaling** area. In the **Containers** area, select the target container tab and click the icon on the right side of **Resource Limits** to update the resource limits according to the recommended values.
