# Creating a native applications without a template via Chart

To develop the current application for distribution to other environments in the future, you can detach the application from the template: Navigate to **Container Platform** > **Application Management** > **Native Applications**, enter the application details page, and click **Actions** > **Detach from Template**.

Before detaching from the template, direct operations on the underlying resources (such as workloads, internal routes, etc.) will only be temporarily effective and will not be recorded in the template. Once the application is updated, the configuration in the template will override the temporary configuration. A detached application is indistinguishable from an application created through the platform [UI form](../create_applications/image_app.mdx) and is not subject to the limitations mentioned above.
