# Managing Storage Usage

View the storage usage data of mounted persistent volumes for reference when using workloads or applications. If the available capacity is insufficient, the persistent volume claim capacity can be expanded accordingly.

## Viewing Persistent Volume Storage Usage

### Notes

- Storage usage data is for reference only and only supports the collection of storage usage data for mounted persistent volumes.

- The total capacity and usage data for PVCs such as HostPath, CephRBD, and TopoLVM may have some discrepancies with actual values.

### Steps

1. Go to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage > Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**.

3. Click on the name of the persistent volume claim.

4. In the **Details** tab, scroll down to the **Storage Usage** area.

5. View the currently used capacity of the mounted persistent volumes and its trend line.

## Expanding Persistent Volume Claim Storage Capacity

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage > Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**.

2. Find the persistent volume claim and click â‹® > **Expand**.

3. Fill in the new capacity.

4. Click **Expand**. The expansion process may take some time, please be patient.
