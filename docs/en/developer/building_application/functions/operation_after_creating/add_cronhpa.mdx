# Configure CronHPA

For stateless applications with periodic fluctuations in business usage, CronHPA (Cron Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) supports adjusting the number of Pods based on the time policies you set.

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that the current cluster has deployed monitoring components and that the monitoring components are operating normally. You can check the deployment and health status of the monitoring components by clicking on the upper right corner of the platform <span style={{ display: 'inline-flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: '4px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}><img src="./assets/question.png" alt="expand" style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> <span>  > **Platform Health Status**, to view the deployment and health status of the monitoring components.</span></span>.

## Steps

1. Enter **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Workloads** -> **Deployments**.

3. Click on ***Deployment Name***.

4. Scroll down to the **Elastic Scaling** section and click **Update** on the right.

5. Select **Scheduled Scaling**, and configure the scaling rules. When the type is **Custom**, the trigger condition must fill out the Crontab expression, which is formatted as `minute hour day month week`. For detailed introduction, please refer to [Writing Crontab Expressions](../../../building_application/how_to/cronjob_rules.mdx).

6. Click **Update**.

## Calculation Rule Explanation

<img src="./assets/pod_scale_schedule.png" />

1. Indicates that starting from 01:00 AM every Monday, only 1 instance will be retained.
2. Indicates that starting from 02:00 AM every Tuesday, only 2 instances will be retained.
3. Indicates that starting from 02:00 AM every Tuesday, only 3 instances will be retained.

**Note**: When multiple rules have the same trigger time (Examples 2 and 3), the platform will execute automatic scaling based only on the rule that is higher in priority (Example 2).
