# Configuring Network Policies

:::info
The platform now provides two different UIs for Network Policies. The old one is maintained for compatibility reasons, while the new one is more flexible and provides a native YAML editor. We recommend using the new version.

Please contact the platform administrator to enable the `network-policy-next` feature gate to access the new UI.
:::

NetworkPolicy is a namespace-scoped Kubernetes resource and implemented by CNI plugins. 
Through network policies, you can control network traffic of Pods, achieving network isolation and reducing the risk of attacks.

By default, all Pods can communicate freely, allowing ingress and egress traffic from any source. 
When a NetworkPolicy is applied, the targeted Pods will only accept traffic that matches the spec.

:::warning
Network policies only apply to container traffic. They don’t affect Pods running in **hostNetwork** mode.

## Steps

1. Enter **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network** > **Network Policies**.

3. Click **Create Network Policy**.

4. Refer to the following instructions to complete the relevant configuration.

   <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <th>Area</th>
         <th colSpan={2}>Parameter</th>
         <th>Description</th>

         <td colSpan={2}>Pod Selector</td>
         <td>Enter the labels of the target Pods in key-value form; if not set, it will apply to all Pods in the current namespace.</td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td colSpan={2}>Preview of Target Pods Affected by Current Policy</td>
         <td>Click <b>Preview</b> to see the target Pods affected by this network policy.</td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td rowSpan={5}>Ingress</td>
         <td colSpan={2}>Block all ingress traffic</td>
         <td>Block all ingress traffic to the target Pod. <br /><br /><b>Note</b>:<ul><li>If Ingress is added to the `spec.policyTypes` field in YAML without configuring specific rules, the <b>Block all ingress traffic</b> option will automatically be checked when switching back to the form.</li><li>If the `spec.ingress`, `spec.egress`, and `spec.policyTypes` fields are simultaneously deleted in YAML, the <b>Block all ingress traffic</b> option will automatically be checked when switching back to the form.</li></ul></td>

       <tr>
         <td rowSpan={3}>Rules<br /><br /><b>Description</b>: If multiple sources are added in the rules, there is a logical <b>OR</b> relationship between them.</td>
         <td>Pods in Current Namespace</td>
         <td>Match Pods with specified labels in the current namespace; only matched Pods can access the target Pod. You can click <b>Preview</b> to see the Pods affected by the current rule.

       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>Pods in Current Cluster</td>
         <td>Match namespaces or Pods with specified labels in the cluster; only matched Pods can access the target Pod.

       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>IP Range</td>
         <td>Enter the CIDR that can access the target Pod and can exclude CIDR ranges that are not allowed to access the target Pod. If this item is not configured, any traffic can access the target Pod.<br /><br /><b>Description</b>: You can add exclusion items in the form of <i>exampleip</i>/32 to exclude a single IP address.</td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td colSpan={2}>Port</td>
         <td>Match traffic on specified protocols and ports; numeric ports or port names on Pods can be added. If this item is not configured, all ports will be matched.</td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td rowSpan={5}>Egress</td>
         <td colSpan={2}>Block all egress traffic</td>
         <td>Block all egress traffic to the target Pod. <br /><br /><b>Note</b>:<ul><li>If Egress is added to the `spec.policyTypes` field in YAML without configuring specific rules, the <b>Block all egress traffic</b> option will automatically be checked when switching back to the form.</li></ul></td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td colSpan={2}>Other Parameters</td>
         <td>Similar to the **Ingress** parameters, this will not be elaborated on here.</td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>

5. Click **Create**.
