# Monitoring Ports

When the protocol of the listening port is HTTPS or HTTP, you can view monitoring data for incoming/outgoing traffic, requests, and responses.

**Note**: Monitoring data for gRPC protocol is not supported.

## Steps to Operate

1. Go to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network** > **Load Balancing**.

3. Click on the name of the load balancer.

4. Click on the name of the listening port.

5. In **Monitoring**, view the monitoring data for the port.

   The formula for calculating the data is `Statistical Data Value = Total Data Amount over Statistical Time Granularity / Statistical Time Granularity`. The traffic value will be converted to an accurate value based on the unit set; if request and response values have decimal places, they will be rounded off and the decimal part will be ignored, with the unit being `units/second`.

   For example: If the statistical time granularity at a certain statistical time point is 4 hours, and the total number of 5xx status code requests and responses over those 4 hours is 10003, then the statistical value for 5xx status code at that time point = 10003 / 4*60*60, rounded off statistical value is 7 units/second.

   | Time Range         | Time Axis Interval | Statistical Time Granularity |
   | ------------ | ----- | ------ |
   | **Last 15 minutes** | 2 minutes  | 30 seconds   |
   | **Last 1 hour**  | 5 minutes  | 1 minute   |
   | **Last 1 day**   | 3 hours  | 30 minutes  |
   | **Last 7 days**   | 1 day   | 4 hours   |
   | **Last 30 days**  | 2 days   | 12 hours  |
