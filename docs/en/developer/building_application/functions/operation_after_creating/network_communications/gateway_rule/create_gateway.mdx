# Create Gateway and Add Listeners

## Create Gateway

Create an inbound gateway to enable more granular allocation of network resources.

### Prerequisites

The platform administrator must ensure that the cluster supports **LoadBalancer** type **internal routing**. For public cloud clusters, the LoadBalancer Service Controller must be installed. In non-public cloud clusters, the platform provides the **external address pool** feature, which allows **LoadBalancer** type **internal routing** to automatically obtain an IP from the external address pool for external access after configuration is complete.

### Steps

**Note**: After the inbound gateway is created, the platform will automatically create many resources. Do not delete the [resources created by the platform](./view_resource.mdx).

1. Enter **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network** > **Inbound Gateway**.

3. Click **Create Inbound Gateway**.

4. Refer to the following instructions to configure specific parameters.

   | Parameter          | Description                                                                                      |
   |------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Name**         | The name of the inbound gateway.                                                                  |
   | **Gateway Class**   | The gateway class defines the behavior of the gateway, similar to the concept of storage classes (StorageClasses); it is a cluster resource. <br />**Dedicated**: The inbound gateway will correspond to a specific resource instance, and the user can utilize all listeners and computing resources of this gateway. |
   | **Specification**    | You can choose the recommended usage scenario based on your needs or customize the resource limits.                                               |
   | **Access Address**   | The address of the inbound gateway, which is automatically obtained by default.                                                                         |
   | **Internal Routing Annotation** | Used to declare the configuration or capabilities for LoadBalancer type internal routing. For specific annotation information, please refer to [LoadBalancer type internal routing annotation instructions](../service/annotation.mdx). |

5. Click **Create**.

## Add Listener

Monitor traffic under specified domain names and forward it to backend instances according to the bound routing rules.

### Prerequisites

- If you need to monitor HTTP protocol, please contact the administrator in advance to prepare the **domain name**.

- If you need to monitor HTTPS protocol, please contact the administrator in advance to prepare the **domain name** and **certificate**.

### Steps

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Network** > **Inbound Gateway**.

2. Click ***Inbound Gateway Name***.

3. Click **Add Listener**.

4. Refer to the following instructions to configure specific parameters.

   | Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
   |----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Listener Protocol and Port** | Currently supports monitoring HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and UDP protocols, and you can custom input the port to be monitored, for example: `80`. <br /><br />**Note**:<br /><ul><li>When the ports are the same, HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP listener types cannot coexist; you can only select one of the protocols.</li><li>When using HTTP or HTTPS protocol, if the ports are the same, the domain names must be different.</li></ul> |
   | **Domain Name**      | Select an available domain name in the current namespace, used to monitor network traffic accessing this domain name. <br />**Hint**: TCP and UDP protocols do not support selecting domain names.                                                         |

5. Click **Create**.

## Follow-up Actions

After the listener is created, please refer to the document [Create Routing Rules](./create_rule.mdx).
