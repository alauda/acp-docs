# Creating Services

In Kubernetes, a Service is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more Pods in your cluster.

## Steps

1. Enter **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network** > **Services**.

3. Click **Create Service**.

4. Refer to the following instructions to configure the relevant parameters.

   | Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Virtual IP Address** | If enabled, a ClusterIP will be allocated for this Service, which can be used for service discovery within the cluster.<br />If disabled, a Headless Service will be created, which is usually used by **StatefulSet**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
   | **Type** | <ul><li>**ClusterIP**: Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. </li><li>**NodePort**: Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). </li><li>**ExternalName**: Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (for example, to the hostname api.foo.bar.example). </li><li>**LoadBalancer**: Exposes the Service externally using an external load balancer. Kubernetes does not directly offer a load balancing component; you must provide one, or you can integrate your Kubernetes cluster with a cloud provider.</li></ul> |
   | **Target Component**  | <ul><li>**Workload**: The Service will forward requests to a **specific** workload, which matches the labels like `project.cpaas.io/name: projectname` and `service.cpaas.io/name: deployment-name`.</li><br /><li>**Virtualization**: The Service will forward requests to a **specific** virtual machine or virtual machine group.</li><br /><li>**Label Selector**: The Service will forward requests to a **certain type** of workload with specified labels, for example, `environment: release`.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | **Port**    | Used to configure the port mapping for this Service. In the following example, other podss within the cluster can call this Service via the virtual IP (if enabled) and TCP port *80*; the access requests will be forwarded to the externally exposed TCP port *6379* or *redis* of the target component's pods.<ul><li>**Protocol**: The protocol used by the Service, supported protocols include: `TCP`, `UDP`, `HTTP`, `HTTP2`, `HTTPS`, `gRPC`.</li><li>**Service Port**: The service port number exposed by the Service within the cluster, that is, Port, e.g., *80*.</li><li>**Container Port**: The target port number (or name) that the service port maps to, that is, targetPort, e.g., *6379* or *redis*.</li><li>**Service Port Name**: Will be generated automatically. The format is `<protocol>-<service port>-<container port>`, for example: *tcp-80-6379* or *tcp-80-redis*.</li></ul>                                                                                                  |
   | **Session Affinity**  | Session affinity based on the source IP address (ClientIP). If enabled, all access requests from the same IP address will be kept on the same server during load balancing, ensuring that requests from the same client are forwarded to the same server for processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

5. Click **Create**.

For LoadBalancer type Services, you can further configure their functionality through annotations. Please refer to [Annotations for LoadBalancer Type Service](./annotation.mdx).
