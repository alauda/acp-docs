# ALB Rules Synced by Ingresses

- When the Ingress rule does not specify an IngressClass or the specified IngressClass is generated by a load balancer.

  - A load balancer created using the **port** resource allocation method will only automatically resolve Ingress rules if the namespace has permissions for ports 80 and 443 and if HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443 are created.

  - A load balancer created using the **instance** resource allocation method will automatically resolve Ingress rules within the namespace when the namespace has load balancer permissions.

  **Note**: To ensure the proper functioning of Ingress rules within the namespace, when only using platform load balancers, please ensure that the namespace has load balancer permissions to resolve Ingress rules.

- When the Ingress rule specifies a non-load balancer generated IngressClass.

  The platform load balancer will no longer resolve Ingress rules, and you must ensure that the specified IngressClass has a Controller available to resolve the Ingress rules.
