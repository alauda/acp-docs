# Creating Ingress

Create an inbound rule (Ingress) to allow access to podss of computing components from outside the cluster.

**Note**: When creating multiple inbound rules within the same namespace, different inbound rules must not have the same **domain name**, **access protocol**, and **path** (i.e., duplicate access addresses are not allowed).

## Prerequisites

- There must be an available **internal route** in the current namespace.

- Please confirm with the administrator that a usable domain name has been allocated for the project associated with the current namespace.

- If the domain needs to be accessed via HTTPS protocol, the HTTPS certificate credentials must be saved in the form of a secret dictionary (TLS type) in advance, and this certificate must be selected for use.

  **Note**: When using a load balancer as the Ingress Controller, it supports using certificates allocated by the platform.

## Steps

1. Access the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network** > **Inbound Rules**.

3. Click **Create Inbound Rule**.

4. Reference the instructions below to configure certain parameters.

   | Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
   | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Ingress Class**        | The Ingress class defines a template for a type of Ingress capability, where Ingress rules sharing the same Ingress class have identical capabilities. If you do not use the Ingress class feature in the **Form** interface, please refer to [Sync Rules](./ingress_rule.mdx); for selecting an already created Ingress class in the **Form** interface, please contact your administrator to enable the relevant features.               |
   | **Domain Name**      | Supports adding **wildcard domains** and **exact domains**; if both wildcard and exact domain configurations exist with the same rule priority, the forwarding rules for the exact domain will take precedence.                                                                                                            |
   | **Certificates**       | If the public cloud Ingress class is selected, the **platform allocated** certificates are not available, and only certificates imported through the **secret dictionary of TLS type** are supported.                                                                                                                  |
   | **Match Type** and **Path** | <ul><li>**Prefix**: Matches path prefixes, e.g., `/abcd` can match `/abcd/efg` or `/abcde`.</li><li>**Exact**: Matches exact paths, e.g., `/abcd`.</li><li>**Controller Decides**: If you are using a custom Ingress controller to manage the Ingress rules, you may choose to have the controller decide.</li></ul> |
   | **Internal Route**    | Access traffic will be forwarded to the computing component specified by the internal route.                                                                                                                                                               |
   | **Service Port**      | Specify which service port the internal route traffic will be forwarded from.                                                                                                                                                                               |

5. Click **Create**.
