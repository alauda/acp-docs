# Introduction

Catalog contains templates or components available for deploying applications and services, designed to provide a unified and efficient resource management and deployment solution for cloud-native applications. By aggregating and organizing various application, service, and solution templates, it offers developers and operations personnel plug-and-play technical components and rapid deployment capabilities. Through Catalog, users can easily acquire, configure, and deploy various pre-configured application services, significantly simplifying the development and delivery process of cloud-native applications.

### Advantages

- Rich Ecosystem of Resources
Provides extensive resource templates covering databases, middleware, development frameworks, and multiple domains, supporting diverse technology stacks and application scenarios to meet the varied requirements of enterprise-level application development. Fully compatible with the Kubernetes ecosystem, enabling quick integration and expansion.

- Standardized Deployment Capabilities
Achieves standardized and repeatable application deployment through pre-configured application templates and deployment configurations. Lowers technical barriers, provides a unified application delivery standard, and ensures deployment consistency and reliability.

- Flexible Customization
Supports users in customizing and extending Catalog resources based on actual business needs. Users can easily add self-developed images and create custom templates to meet personalized application deployment requirements.

- Security and Compliance
Deeply integrated with the platform's security mechanisms, providing strict access control and image security scanning. Ensures that Catalog resources comply with enterprise security standards, reducing application deployment security risks.

### Scenarios

- Rapid Microservices Construction
Developers can quickly select and deploy microservice components through Catalog, such as service registration, configuration centers, message queues, etc., significantly shortening the microservice architecture development cycle.

- Continuous Integration and Delivery
Provides DevOps teams with standardized application templates and deployment processes, supporting continuous integration, automated deployment, and version management to improve R&D efficiency.

- Multi-Environment Consistent Deployment
Supports standardized deployment across development, testing, production, and other environments, ensuring application configuration and runtime environment consistency, and reducing environment configuration complexity.

- Rapid Prototype Development
Offers immediately deployable technical components for innovative projects and prototype development, helping R&D teams quickly validate innovative ideas and accelerate product iteration.
