# Managing Application Templates

The update of template applications relies on the updates of application templates (Helm Charts). If certain templates cannot be automatically updated via the platform upgrade, public repositories, or custom private repositories, you can manually add them to a Chart or OCI Chart type template repository with **Management** permissions for deploying the corresponding version of the application.

## Prerequisites

Template repositories are added by platform administrators. Please contact the platform administrator to obtain the available Chart or OCI Chart type template repository names with **Management** permissions.

## Adding Templates to Manageable Repositories

1. Go to **Catalog**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Helm Charts**.

3. Click **Add Template** in the upper right corner of the page, and select the template repository based on the parameters below.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                 |
   | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Template Repository** | Synchronize the template directly to a Chart or OCI Chart type template repository with **Management** permissions. Project owners assigned to this **Template Repository** can directly use the template.                                          |
   | **Template Directory** | When the selected template repository type is OCI Chart, a directory to store the Helm Chart must be selected or manually entered. <br />**Note**: When manually entering a new template directory, the platform will create this directory in the template repository, but there is a risk of creation failure. |

4. Click **Upload Template** and upload the local template to the repository.

5. Click **Confirm**. The template upload process may take a few minutes, please be patient.

   **Note**: When the template status changes from `Uploading` to `Upload Successful`, it indicates that the template has been uploaded successfully.

6. If the upload fails, please troubleshoot according to the following prompts.

   **Note**: An illegal file format means there is an issue with the files in the uploaded compressed package, such as missing content or incorrect formatting.

## Deleting Specific Versions of Templates

If a version of a template is no longer applicable, it can be deleted.

### Steps to Operate

1. Go to **Catalog**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Helm Charts**.

3. Click on the Chart card to view details.

4. Click **Manage Versions**.

5. Find the template that is no longer applicable, click **Delete**, and confirm.

   After deleting the version, the corresponding application will not be able to be updated.
