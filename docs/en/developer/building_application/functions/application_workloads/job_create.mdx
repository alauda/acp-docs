# Creating Jobs

Job provide different ways to define tasks that run to completion and then stop. You can use a Job to define a task that runs to completion, just once.

- **Atomic Execution Unit**: Each Job manages one or more Pods until successful completion.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Controlled by `spec.backoffLimit` (default: 6).
- **Completion Tracking**: Use `spec.completions` to define required success count.

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: data-processing-job
spec:
  completions: 1          # Number of successful completions required
  parallelism: 1          # Maximum parallel Pods
  backoffLimit: 3         # Maximum retry attempts
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never # Job-specific policy (Never/OnFailure)
      containers:
      - name: processor
        image: alpine:3.14
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args:
          - echo "Processing data..."; sleep 30; echo "Job completed"
```

## Execution Overview
Each Job execution in Kubernetes creates a dedicated Job object, enabling users to:
- Track job lifecycle through `kubectl get jobs`
- Inspect execution details via `kubectl describe job/<job-name>`
- View Pod logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
