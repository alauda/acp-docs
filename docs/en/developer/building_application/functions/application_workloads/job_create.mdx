# Create Job

Each scheduled task execution creates a job, where you can view the relevant information about the job and examine its execution status.

## Steps to Operate

1. Go to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Compute Components** > **Tasks**.

3. Find the task and click ⋮ > **View**.

4. In the **Container Group** tab, click ***Container Group Name*** to view the details of the container group executing the task.

   You can also perform operations related to the container.

   - EXEC into the container: Click ⋮ > **EXEC** > ***Container Name***.

   - Delete the container group: Click ⋮ > **Delete** and confirm.

5. In the **Configuration** tab, view all environment variable key-value pairs used by the container instance during runtime.

   - **Environment Variables**: Key-value pairs of environment variables, or information from the referenced configuration dictionary or secret dictionary.

   - **Configuration References**: Information of the complete configuration file (configuration dictionary or secret dictionary) referenced.

6. In the **Real-time Logs** tab, view the container logs generated by the application container instance during runtime, which can be used to analyze the reasons for task execution failure.

   **Note**: If the container group records are deleted, the associated logs will also be deleted.

7. In the **Events** tab, you can view the event information for all Kubernetes resources under the current compute component within a specified time range.
