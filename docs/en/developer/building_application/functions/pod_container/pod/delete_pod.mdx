# Delete Pod

Deleting a container group may affect the operation of computing components; please proceed with caution.

## Use Cases

- Restore the container group to its desired state promptly: If a container group remains in a state that affects business operations, such as `Pending` or `CrashLoopBackOff`, manually deleting the container group after addressing the error message can help it quickly return to its desired state, such as `Running`. At this time, the deleted container group will be rebuilt on the current node or rescheduled.

- Resource cleanup for operations management: Some container groups reach a designated stage where they no longer change, and these groups often accumulate in large numbers, complicating the management of other container groups. The container groups to be cleaned up may include those in the `Evicted` status due to insufficient node resources or those in the `Completed` status triggered by recurring scheduled tasks. In this case, the deleted container groups will no longer exist.

  **Note**: For scheduled tasks, if you need to check the logs of each task execution, it is not recommended to delete the corresponding `Completed` status container groups.

## Steps

1. Go to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Compute Components** > **Container Groups**.

3. (Delete individually) Click the â‹® on the right side of the container group to be deleted > **Delete**, and confirm.

4. (Delete in bulk) Select the container groups to be deleted, click **Delete** above the list, and confirm.
