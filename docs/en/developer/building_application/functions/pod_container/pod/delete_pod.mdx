# Deleting Pods

Deleting pods may affect the operation of computing components; please proceed with caution.

## Use Cases

- Restore the pods to its desired state promptly: If a pods remains in a state that affects business operations, such as `Pending` or `CrashLoopBackOff`, manually deleting the pods after addressing the error message can help it quickly return to its desired state, such as `Running`. At this time, the deleted pods will be rebuilt on the current node or rescheduled.

- Resource cleanup for operations management: Some podss reach a designated stage where they no longer change, and these groups often accumulate in large numbers, complicating the management of other podss. The podss to be cleaned up may include those in the `Evicted` status due to insufficient node resources or those in the `Completed` status triggered by recurring scheduled tasks. In this case, the deleted podss will no longer exist.

  **Note**: For scheduled tasks, if you need to check the logs of each task execution, it is not recommended to delete the corresponding `Completed` status podss.

## Procedure

1. Go to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Workloads** > **Pods**.

3. (Delete individually) Click the ⋮ on the right side of the pods to be deleted > **Delete**, and confirm.

4. (Delete in bulk) Select the podss to be deleted, click **Delete** above the list, and confirm.
