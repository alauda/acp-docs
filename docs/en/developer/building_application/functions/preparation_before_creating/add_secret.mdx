# Configuring Secrets

Create a secret dictionary based on your needs, select the appropriate type of secret dictionary, and configure the parameters.

## Operation Steps

1. Access **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Configuration** > **Secret Dictionary**.

3. Click **Create Secret Dictionary**.

4. Configure the parameters.

   **Note**: In the form view, sensitive data such as the input username and password will automatically be encoded in Base64 format before being stored in the secret dictionary. The converted data can be previewed in the YAML view.

5. Click **Create**.

## Follow-up Actions

When creating computation components for native applications in the same namespace, you can reference the secret dictionaries that have already been created.

| **Update**   | After adding or updating a secret dictionary, computation components that have referenced this secret dictionary (or its configuration items) via environment variables need to have their Pods rebuilt for the new configuration to take effect.                          |
| **Delete**   | <ul><li>After deleting a secret dictionary, computation components that have referenced this secret dictionary (or its configuration items) via environment variables may be impacted due to the inability to find the reference source when rebuilding Pods.</li><li>Please do not delete the secret dictionaries automatically generated by the platform, as this may prevent the platform from functioning properly. For example: secret dictionaries of type service-account-token that contain authentication information for namespace resources and secret dictionaries in system namespaces (such as kube-system).</li></ul> |
