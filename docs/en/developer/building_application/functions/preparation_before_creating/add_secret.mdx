| **Update**   | After adding or updating a Secret, workloads that have referenced this Secret (or its configuration items) via environment variables need to have their Pods rebuilt for the new configuration to take effect.                          |
| **Delete**   | <ul><li>After deleting a Secret, workloads that have referenced this Secret (or its configuration items) via environment variables may be impacted due to the inability to find the reference source when rebuilding Pods.</li><li>Please do not delete the Secrets automatically generated by the platform, as this may prevent the platform from functioning properly. For example: Secrets of type service-account-token that contain authentication information for namespace resources and Secrets in system namespaces (such as kube-system).</li></ul> |
