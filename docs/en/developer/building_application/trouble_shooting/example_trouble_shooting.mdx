Introduce common issues users might encounter and their resolutions. If the content is brief, include it directly on the "Troubleshooting" single page. If the content is extensive, use "Troubleshooting" as an index, with each issue as a separate document.

You can visit the [Troubleshooting Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to see corresponding document samples.

:::

# \<Title: Usually the issue name>

## Issue Description

Provide detailed information on the environment in which the issue occurred, its scope, and the symptoms of the issue. Additionally, include the following supporting information as appropriate:

- Problem Screenshot: Text descriptions are recommended first; if text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used. Users need to register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Relevant Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this issue (this can be a single confirmed cause or multiple potential causes). Each cause must meet the following criteria:

1. It must be an actual cause that has been verified to lead to this issue, not a hypothetical or assumed reason.
2. Provide a detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How this cause triggered the issue.
   - The specific mechanisms and processes by which the issue occurred.

## Problem Troubleshooting (Optional)

List the specific steps for troubleshooting the issue in detail. Through troubleshooting, users can choose the most likely or certain cause from multiple reasons and apply suitable solutions to resolve the issue. Points to note in troubleshooting include:

- If there is only one root cause, then provide troubleshooting steps, preferably in an ordered list format.
  
  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different troubleshooting steps, use a third-level heading for each root cause and provide detailed troubleshooting steps under each.
  
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be "Solution")

Specific precautions, prerequisites, and steps for resolving the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level title should be "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes, each solution corresponding to a root cause should have its own second-level title, such as "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," etc.

### Precautions (Optional)

Precautions to consider before starting operations; failing to read this section carefully may lead to operational failure or even more severe consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that must be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level heading can be omitted if there are no precautions or prerequisites)

- Operational steps are usually presented in an ordered list format; if the steps are complex, use fourth-level headings to distinguish between each step, with specific steps listed as ordered lists under each.
- If operations are performed on a container platform, provide a complete list of detailed steps for each operation; if operations are conducted on a third-party platform or other software, only key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if details are written too thoroughly, we cannot guarantee timely updates to the documentation as the interface changes, which may lead to numerous issues. To ensure the long-term usability of documentation, descriptions of third-party platform operational steps should adhere to the following principles:
  >
  > - Focus on core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain the generality and flexibility of operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic flow of the operations.

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be removed)

Content in this section follows the same format as the solution for Root Cause 1 and will not be repeated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of this issue (suggestions, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can contain content referenced in the document but is inconvenient to include in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
