# Build application architecture

## Introduction to build application

Alauda Container Platform is a platform for developing and running containerized applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to thousands of machines that serve millions of clients. 

Built on Kubernetes, Alauda Container Platform leverages the same robust technology that powers large-scale telecommunications, streaming video, gaming, banking, and other critical applications. This foundation enables you to extend your containerized applications across hybrid environments - from on-premise infrastructure to multi-cloud deployments.

## Core components

### Archon

Provides advanced APIs for application and resource management operations. As a control plane component, `Archon` exclusively runs on the `global` cluster, serving as the central management interface for cluster-wide operations. Its API layer enables declarative configuration of applications, namespaces, and infrastructure resources across the entire platform.

### Metis

Functions as the multi-purpose controller within `business clusters`, delivering critical cluster-level operations:
- **Webhook management**: Implements admission webhooks for resource validation, including `resources ratio` enforcement and `resource labeling` policies and so on.
- **Status synchronization**: Maintains consistency across distributed components through:
  - `Helm chart application` status reconciliation
  - `Project quota` synchronization
  - `Application` status updates (writing to application.status fields)
         
### Captain controller manager               

Serves as the `Helm chart` application lifecycle management controller operating exclusively on the `global cluster`. Its responsibilities include:
- **Chart installation**: Orchestrating deployment of `Helm chart` across clusters
- **Version management**: Handling seamless upgrades and rollbacks of `Helm chart` releases
- **Uninstallation**: Complete removal of `Helm chart` application and associated resources
- **Release tracking**: Maintaining state and history of all deployed `Helm chart` releases

### Icarus

Provides the centralized web-based management interface for `Container Platform`. As the presentation layer component, `Icarus`:
- Delivers comprehensive dashboard visualizations for cluster health monitoring
- Enables GUI-based application deployment and management workflows
- **Implements Kubernetes RBAC-based multi-tenant management**:
  - Distinguishes tenant accounts through namespace isolation
  - Manages resource access permissions per tenant
  - Provides tenant-specific view isolation
- Exclusively runs on the `global cluster`, serving as the unified control point for multi-cluster operations
