# Application Types

In the platform's **Container Platform > Applications**, the following types of applications can be created:

- **Custom Application**: A Custom Application represents a complete business application composed of one or more interconnected computing components (such as Workloads like Deployments or StatefulSets), internal networking configurations (Services), and other native Kubernetes resources. This type of application offers flexible creation methods, supporting direct UI editing, YAML orchestration, and templated deployments, making it suitable for development, testing, and production environments. To learn more about this application type, refer to [Custom Application](./custom_application.mdx). Different types of native applications can be created in the following ways:
  - **[Create from Image](../create_applications/image_app.mdx)**: Quickly create applications using existing container images.
  - **[Create from YAML](../create_applications/yaml_app.mdx)**: Create applications using YAML configuration files.
  - **[Create from Code](../create_applications/s2i_app.mdx)**: Create applications using source code.
- **Helm Chart Application**: A Helm Chart Application allows you to deploy and manage applications packaged as Helm Charts. Helm Charts are bundles of pre-configured Kubernetes resources that can be deployed as a single unit, simplifying the installation and management of complex applications. To learn more about this application type, refer to [Helm Chart Application](../working_with_helm_charts.mdx#understandinghelm)
- **Operator Backed Application**: An Operator-Backed Application leverages the power of Kubernetes Operators to automate the lifecycle management of complex applications. By deploying an application backed by an Operator, you benefit from automated deployment, scaling, upgrades, and maintenance, as the Operator acts as an intelligent controller tailored to the specific application. To learn more about this application type, refer to [Operator Backed Application](../../building_application/create_applications/operator_app.mdx#UnderStandingoperatorbackedapplication).
