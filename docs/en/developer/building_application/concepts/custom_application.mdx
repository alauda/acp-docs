# Custom Applications

## UnderStanding Custom Applications
A Custom Application is an application paradigm built on native Kubernetes resources (e.g., Deployment, Service, ConfigMap), strictly adhering to Kubernetes declarative API design principles. Users can define and deploy applications through standard YAML files or direct Kubernetes API calls, enabling fine-grained control over the application lifecycle. These are created from sources such as Images, code, and YAML are classified as custom application in Alauda Container Platform. Its design core lies in balancing flexibility and standardization, ideal for scenarios requiring deeply customized management.

### Core Capabilities
1. **Declarative API-Driven Management**
  - Aggregates distributed resources (e.g., Deployment, Service, Ingress) into a logical application unit through Application CRD, enabling atomic operations.

2. **Application-Level Abstraction & State Aggregation**

  - Masks low-level resource details (e.g., Pod replica status). Developers can monitor overall application health (e.g., ready endpoint ratio, version consistency) directly via the Application resource.
 
  - Supports cross-component dependency declarations (e.g., database service must start before application service) to ensure resource initialization order and coordination.

3. **Full Lifecycle Governance**
  - Version Control: Tracks historical configurations, enabling one-click rollback to any stable state.

  - Dependency Resolution: Automatically identifies and manages version compatibility between components (e.g., matching Service API versions with Ingress controllers).

4. **Enhanced Observability**
  - Aggregates status metrics of all associated resources (e.g., Deployment available replicas, Service traffic load), providing a global view through a unified Dashboard.

### Design Value
| **Dimension**                 | **Value Proposition**         |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Complexity Management**      | Encapsulates scattered resources (e.g., Deployment, Service) into a single logical entity, reducing cognitive and operational overhead.          |
| **Standardization** | Unifies application description standards via Application CRD, eliminating management entropy caused by YAML fragmentation. |
| **Ecosystem Compatibility** | Ecosystem Compatibility	Seamlessly integrates with native toolchains (e.g., kubectl, Kubernetes Dashboard) and supports Helm Chart extensions.|
| DevOps Efficiency | Implements declarative delivery through GitOps pipelines (e.g., Argo CD), accelerating CI/CD automation.|

## Custom Application CRD Architecture Design
The Custom Application module defines two core CRD resources, forming atomic abstraction units for application management:

| **Dimension**                 | **Value Proposition**         |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
|**Application** | Describes metadata and component topology of logical application units, aggregating resources like Deployment/Service into a single entity.|
|**ApplicationHistory** | Records all application lifecycle operations (create/update/rollback/delete) as versioned snapshots, tightly coupled with the Application CRD to enable end-to-end change traceability.|

### Application CRD Define
The Application CRD uses the `spec.componentKinds` field to declare Kubernetes resource types (e.g., Deployment, Service), enabling cross-resource lifecycle management.
