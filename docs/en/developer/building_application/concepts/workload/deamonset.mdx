# In-depth Understanding of DaemonSet

A DaemonSet is a type of controller in Kubernetes that manages compute components. You can create a DaemonSet to run a program on the platform, and you can also create multiple DaemonSets within an application as compute components to provide specific services for the application.

The features of DaemonSet are as follows:

- It ensures that a Pod replica runs on all or some of the nodes that meet the conditions.
  
- When a node is added to the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically adds Pod replicas from the DaemonSet to the newly added node.
  
- When a node is removed from the cluster, the Pods on that node are reclaimed.
  
- When the DaemonSet is deleted, all Pods created by that DaemonSet will also be deleted.

Common use cases for DaemonSet include:

- Running a cluster storage daemon, such as: glusterd or ceph, on every node in the cluster.
  
- Running a log collection daemon, such as: fluentd or logstash, on every node in the cluster.
  
- Running a node monitoring daemon, such as: Prometheus Node Exporter, Sysdig Agent, collectd, Dynatrace OneAgent, AppDynamics Agent, Datadog agent, New Relic agent, Ganglia gmond, or Instana Agent on every node in the cluster.
