# Creating OAM Applications

The **OAM Applications** is based on the Open Application Model, which is a higher-level integration and abstraction of containers and kubernetes resources, and includes multiple components under one OAM application. The OAM application allows you to manage your application at a higher level, shielding it as much as possible from the container and kubernetes layers, allowing you to focus more on the operation and maintenance of the application itself.

## Creating OAM Applications from Form

### Prerequisites
1. Install **Alauda Container Platform Application Management for KubeVela**.
2. Obtain the image address. The source of the images can be from the image repository integrated by the Administrator through the toolchain or from third-party platforms' image repositories.

   - For the former, the Administrator typically assigns the image repository to your project, and you can use the images within it. If the required image repository is not found, please contact the Administrator for allocation.

   - If it is a third-party platform's image repository, ensure that images can be pulled directly from it in the current cluster.


### Procedure

1. **Container Platform**, and navigate to **Applications** > **OAM Applications**.

2. Click **Create Application**.

3. Click **Create from Image**.

4. Fill in the application name and set labels or annotations.


   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |:--------------------------|:--------------------------|
   | **Labels**  | Used to select objects and find a collection of objects that meet certain conditions. It needs to be in the form of key-value pairs, for example, `app.kubernetes.io/name: {hello-app}`. |
   | **Annotations** | Used to provide any information to the development and operation teams. It needs to be in the form of key-value pairs, for example, cpaas.io/maintainer: kim. Note: If the annotation value is a clickable link, set the key as `app.{texts}.url`. |

6. Click **Add Component**.

7. Select a type of component and click **Next**.

8. Continue to configure properties, add operational features, and so on.

   - [Component Concepts](../../oam_applications/concepts/component.mdx)
 
   - [Trait Concepts](../../oam_applications/concepts/trait.mdx)

   **Note**: You can configure operational traits immediately or wait until the environment is ready before configuring.

## Creating OAM Applications from YAML

If you are proficient at creating applications or wish to quickly migrate applications within the cluster, you can use a YAML file to complete the required component and operational trait configuration with one click. In addition to the YAML samples provided by the platform, you can also visit the [OAM Open Source Community](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/blob/master/7.application.md) for further guidance on writing application YAML.

### Prerequisites

- If it is a third-party platform's image repository, ensure that images can be pulled directly from it in the current cluster.
Execute the `docker pull` command to verify.

### Restrictions

If you are exporting a YAML file from an existing OAM application, please modify the application name and component name in the YAML to avoid naming conflicts in the same namespace.

### Procedure

1. **Container Platform**, and navigate to **Applications** > **OAM Applications**.

2. Click **Create Application**.

3. Click **Create from YAML**.

4. Fill in the YAML content and click **Create**.

   After the creation is complete, you can update the application or component normally through the web console.
