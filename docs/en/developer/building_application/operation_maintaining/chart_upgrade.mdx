# Updating and deleting Chart Applications

Due to overlapping functionality between the current template applications and native applications, and the enhanced operational capabilities available under native applications, independent management of template applications will no longer be offered in future versions. Please upgrade your currently successfully deployed template applications to native applications as soon as possible.

## Important Notes

This feature is **going to be discontinued**. Please upgrade your currently successfully deployed template applications to native applications as soon as possible.

## Prerequisites

Please contact the platform administrator to enable template application-related features.
