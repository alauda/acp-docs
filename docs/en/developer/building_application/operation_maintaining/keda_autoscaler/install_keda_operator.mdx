# Installing KEDA

## Prerequisites

KEDA is a tool that helps Kubernetes scale applications based on real-world events. With KEDA, you can adjust the size of your containers automatically, depending on the workload—like the number of messages in a queue or incoming requests.

1. **Download** the **KEDA** installation package from **Alauda Cloud**.
2. **Upload** the installation package using the Upload Packages mechanism.

:::info
Upload Packages:
**Platform Management** > **Marketplace** > **Upload Packages** page.
Click **Help Document** on the right to get instructions on how to publish the operator to cluster. For more details, please refer to [CLI](/ui/cli_tools/index.mdx).

| **Version**   | Please select the latest version.|
| **Installation Mode** | `Cluster`: A single Operator is shared across all namespaces in the cluster for instance creation and management, resulting in lower resource usage.                          |
| **Installation Location** | `Recommended`: It will be created automatically if it does not exist. |
| **Upgrade Strategy** | Please select the `Auto`. <ul><li>the **Upgrade** action will be executed automatically.</li></ul> |

4. On the parameter configuration page for the instance, you may use the default configuration unless there are specific requirements.

5. Click **Create**.

### Verification

- After the instance is successfully created, wait approximately 20 minutes, then checking if the KEDA components is already running with the command: 
```bash
kubectl get pods -n keda
```

## Additional Scenarios

### Integrating ACP Log Collector

- Ensure **ACP Log Collector Plugin** is installed in target cluster. Refer to [ACP Log Collector Plugin Install](/observability/log/install_log#install-acp-log-collector-plugin)
- Enable the **Platform** logging switch when installing the **ACP Log Collector Plugin**.
- Use the following command to add label to the **keda** namespace:
```bash
kubectl label namespace keda cpaas.io/product=Container-Platform --overwrite
```
