# Pausing Autoscaling in KEDA

KEDA allows you to pause autoscaling of workloads temporarily, which is useful for:

- Cluster maintenance.
- Avoiding resource starvation by scaling down non-critical workloads.

## Procedure

- Immediate Pause with Current Replicas

Add the following annotation to your **ScaledObject** definition to pause scaling without changing the current replica count:
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    autoscaling.keda.sh/paused: "true"
```

- Pause After Scaling to a Specific Replica Count

Use this annotation to scale the workload to a specific number of replicas and then pause:
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-replicas: "<number>"
```

- Behavior When Both Annotations Are Set

If both paused and paused-replicas are specified:
  - KEDA scales the workload to the value defined in paused-replicas.
  - Autoscaling is paused afterward.

- Unpausing Autoscaling

To resume autoscaling:
  - Remove both paused and paused-replicas annotations from the ScaledObject.
  - If only paused: "true" was used, set it to false:
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    autoscaling.keda.sh/paused: "false"
```

## Scaling to Zero

Example ScaledObject Configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: example-scaledobject
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-replicas: "0"  # Scale to 0 replicas and pause
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: example-deployment
  triggers:
    - type: cpu
      metadata:
        targetAverageUtilization: "80"
```

## Verification

To verify that the ScaledObject has scaled to zero, you can check the number of replicas of the target deployment:
```bash
kubectl get deployment example-deployment -n default
```

Or you can check the number of pods in the target deployment:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n default -l app=example-deployment
```
The number of pods should be zero, indicating that the deployment has scaled to zero.
