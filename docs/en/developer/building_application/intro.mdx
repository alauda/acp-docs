# Overview

<Term name="product" /> provides a unified interface to create, edit, delete, and manage cloud-native applications through both a web console and CLI (Command-Line Interface). Applications can be deployed across multiple namespaces with RBAC policies.

## Namespace Management

Namespaces provide logical isolation for Kubernetes resources. Key operations include:

- [Creating Namespaces](./functions/namespace/create_namespace.mdx): Define resource quotas and pod security admission policies.
- [Importing Namespaces](./functions/namespace/import_namespace.mdx): Importing existing Kubernetes namespaces into <Term name="product" /> provides full platform capabilities parity with natively created namespaces.

## Application Lifecycle Management
<Term name="product" /> supports end-to-end lifecycle management including: 

### Application Creation Patterns

In <Term name="product"/>, applications can be created in multiple ways. Here are some common methods:

- [Create from Images](./functions/create_applications/image_app.mdx): Create custom applications using pre-built container images. This method supports creating complete application that include `Deployments`, `Services`, `ConfigMaps`, and other Kubernetes resources.
- [Create from Catalog](./functions/create_applications/chart_app.mdx): <Term name="product" /> provides application catalogs, allowing users to select predefined application templates (Helm Charts or Operator Backed) for creation.
- [Create from YAML](./functions/create_applications/yaml_app.mdx): By importing a YAML file, create a custom application with all included resources in one step.
- [Create from Code](./functions/create_applications/s2i_app.mdx): Build images via Source to Image (S2I).

### Application Operations
- [Updating Applications](./functions/application_operation/application_upgrade.mdx): Update an application's image version, environment variables, and other configurations, or import existing Kubernetes resources for centralized management.
- [Exporting Applications](./functions/application_operation/export.mdx): Export applications in YAML, Kustomize, or Helm Chart formats, then import them to create new application instances in other namespaces or clusters.
- [Version Management](./functions/application_operation/version.mdx): Support automatically or manually creating application versions, and in case of issues, one-click rollback to a specific version is available for quick recovery.
- [Deleting Applications](./functions/application_operation/application_delete.mdx): Delete an application, it simultaneously deletes the application itself and all of its directly contained Kubernetes resources. Additionally, this action severs any association the application might have had with other Kubernetes resources that were not directly part of its definition.

### Application Observability
For continuous operation management, the platform provides logs, events, monitoring, etc.
- [Logs](./functions/application_observability/log.mdx): Supports viewing real-time logs from the currently running Pod, and also provides logs from previous container restarts.
- [Events](./functions/application_observability/event.mdx): Supports viewing event information for all resources within a namespace.
- [Monitoring Dashboards](./functions/application_observability/monitor.mdx): Provides namespace-level monitoring dashboards, including dedicated views for Applications, Workloads, and Pods, and also support customizing monitoring dashboards to suit specific operational requirements.

## Kubernetes Workload Management

Support for core workload types:
- [Deployments](./functions/application_workloads/deployment_create.mdx): Manage stateless applications with rolling updates.
- [StatefulSets](./functions/application_workloads/statefulset_create.mdx): Run stateful apps with stable network IDs.
- [DaemonSets](./functions/application_workloads/deamonset_create.mdx): Deploy node-level services (e.g., log collectors).
- [CronJobs](./functions/application_workloads/cronjob_create.mdx): Schedule batch jobs with retry policies.
