# Overview

Creating and managing applications on Alauda Container Platform. Using <Term name="product" textCase="lower" />, you can create, edit, delete, and manage applications using the web console or command-line interface (CLI).

## Advantages

### Creating namespace
- [Creating Namespace](./functions/namespace/create_namespace.mdx)

### Creating Applications
In <Term name="product" textCase="lower" />, applications can be created in multiple ways. Here are some common methods:
- [Create from Images](./functions/create_applications/image_app.mdx): If you already have a container image, you can directly create an application from it.
- [Create from Catalog](./functions/create_applications/chart_app.mdx): <Term name="product" textCase="lower" /> provides application catalogs, allowing users to select predefined application templates (Helm Charts or Operator-Backed) for creation.
- [Create from YAML](./functions/create_applications/yaml_app.mdx): By importing a YAML file, create a custom application with all included resources in one step.
- [Create from Code](./functions/create_applications/s2i_app.mdx): By selecting or inputting a code repository address to import code, automatically build an image and create an application.

### Application Observability
Continuous operation management is required, including logs, events, monitoring, etc.
- View pod logs.
- View events in the namespace.
- View monitoring dashboards via Container Platform (namespace-level Monitoring dashboard).

### Full Lifecycle Management of Applications
<Term name="product" textCase="lower" /> provides application lifecycle management support, from application creation, runtime, updates, to eventual decommissioning. Operations such as rolling updates and rollbacks can be performed using resources like Applications and other Kubernetes workloads.
