# Introduction
> <Term name="product" textCase="lower" /> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management of multi-cloud and multi-cluster, greatly simplifying the cloud application process for enterprises, and effectively reducing operation and maintenance management and labor costs. With container management, you can conveniently create Kubernetes clusters and rapidly build an enterprise-grade container cloud management platform.

## Building applications Overview
Creating and managing applications on Alauda Container Platform. Using <Term name="product" textCase="lower" />, you can create, edit, delete, and manage applications using the web console or command line interface (CLI).

## Advantages

### Create applications
In <Term name="product" textCase="lower" />, applications can be created in multiple ways. Here are some common methods:
- Create from Images: If you already have a container image, you can directly create an application from it.
- Create from Catalog: <Term name="product" textCase="lower" /> provide application catalogs, allowing users to select predefined application templates (Helm Chart or Operator Backed) for creating.
- Create from YAML File: By importing a YAML file, create a custom application with all included resources in one step.
- Create from Code: By selecting or inputting a code repository address to import code, automatically build an image and create a application.

### Application operation management
Continuous operation management is required, including logs, events, monitoring, etc.
- View Pod logs.
- View events in the Namespace.
- View monitoring dashboards via Container Platform (Namespace-level monitoring Dashboard).

### Full Lifecycle Management of applications
<Term name="product" textCase="lower" /> provides application lifecycle management support, from application creation, runtime, updates, to eventual decommissioning. Operations such as rolling updates and rollbacks can be performed using resources like Applications and other Kubernetes workloads.
