# Introduction

Creating and managing applications on Alauda Container Platform. Using <Term name="product" textCase="lower" />, you can create, edit, delete, and manage applications using the web console or command-line interface (CLI).

## Advantages

### Create Applications
In <Term name="product" textCase="lower" />, applications can be created in multiple ways. Here are some common methods:
- Create from Images: If you already have a container image, you can directly create an application from it.
- Create from Catalog: <Term name="product" textCase="lower" /> provides application catalogs, allowing users to select predefined application templates (Helm Charts or Operator-Backed) for creation.
- Create from YAML File: By importing a YAML file, create a custom application with all included resources in one step.
- Create from Code: By selecting or inputting a code repository address to import code, automatically build an image and create an application.

### Application Management
Continuous operation management is required, including logs, events, monitoring, etc.
- View pod logs.
- View events in the namespace.
- View monitoring dashboards via Container Platform (namespace-level Monitoring dashboard).
