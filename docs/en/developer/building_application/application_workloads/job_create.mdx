# Jobs

## Understanding Jobs

Refer to the official Kubernetes documentation: [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)

A **Job** provide different ways to define tasks that run to completion and then stop. You can use a Job to define a task that runs to completion, just once.

- **Atomic Execution Unit**: Each Job manages one or more Pods until successful completion.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Controlled by `spec.backoffLimit` (default: 6).
- **Completion Tracking**: Use `spec.completions` to define required success count.

## YAML file example

```yaml
# example-job.yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: data-processing-job
spec:
  completions: 1 # Number of successful completions required
  parallelism: 1 # Maximum parallel Pods
  backoffLimit: 3 # Maximum retry attempts
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never # Job-specific policy (Never/OnFailure)
      containers:
        - name: processor
          image: alpine:3.14
          command: ['/bin/sh', '-c']
          args:
            - echo "Processing data..."; sleep 30; echo "Job completed"
```

## Execution Overview

Each Job execution in Kubernetes creates a dedicated Job object, enabling users to:

- **Creating a job via**

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f example-job.yaml
  ```

- **Track job lifecycle via**

  ```bash
  kubectl get jobs
  ```

- **Inspect execution details via**

  ```bash
  kubectl describe job/<job-name>
  ```

- **View Pod logs via**

  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```
