# Setting Scheduled Task Trigger Rules

The scheduled task trigger rules support the input of Crontab expressions.

## Time Conversion

**Time conversion rule**: local time - time zone offset = UTC

Taking **Beijing time to UTC time** as an example:

Beijing is in the East Eight Time Zone, with a time difference of 8 hours between Beijing time and UTC. The time conversion rule is:

`Beijing Time - 8 = UTC`

**Example 1**: Beijing time 9:42 converts to UTC time: 42 09 - 00 08 = 42 01, which means the UTC time is 1:42 AM.

**Example 2**: Beijing time 4:32 AM converts to UTC time: 32 04 - 00 08 = -68 03. If the result is negative, it indicates the previous day, requiring another conversion: -68 03 + 00 24 = 32 20, which means the UTC time is 8:32 PM of the previous day.

## Writing Crontab Expressions

**Basic format and value range of Crontab**: `minute hour day month weekday`, with the corresponding value ranges please refer to the table below:

| Minute    | Hour      | Day    | Month                  | Weekday                |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| \[0-59] | \[0-23] | \[1-31] | \[1-12] or \[JAN-DEC] | \[0-6] or \[SUN-SAT] |

The special characters allowed in the `minute hour day month weekday` field include:

- `,`: Value list separator, used to specify multiple values. For example: `1,2,5,7,8,9`.
- `-`: User-defined value range. For example: `2-4`, which represents 2, 3, 4.
- `*`: Represents the entire time period. For example, when used for minutes, it means every minute.
- `/`: Used to specify the increment of values. For example: `n/m` indicates starting from n, increasing by m each time.

**Common Examples**:

- Input `30 18 25 12 *` indicates a task triggers at `18:30:00 on December 25th`.

- Input `30 18 25 * 6` indicates a task triggers at `18:30:00 every Saturday`.

- Input `30 18 * * 6` indicates a task triggers at `18:30:00 on the coming Saturdays`.

- Input `* 18 * * *` indicates a task triggers every minute starting from the next effective `18:00:00` (including `18:00:00`).

- Input `0 18 1,10,22 * *` indicates a task triggers at `18:00:00 on the 1st, 10th, and 22nd of every month`.

- Input `0,30 18-23 * * *` indicates a task triggers at `00 minutes and 30 minutes of each hour between 18:00 and 23:00 daily`.

- Input `* */1 * * *` indicates a task triggers every 1 minute.

- Input `* 2-7/1 * * *` indicates a task triggers every minute between 2 AM and 7 AM daily.

- Input `0 11 4 * mon-wed` indicates a task triggers at `11 AM on the 4th of every month and on every Monday to Wednesday`.
