:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Any "concepts" introduced in the architecture are recommended to be linked to the corresponding sections in the "Core Concepts" below. If the "concepts" introduced are relatively simple and do not require a separate document for explanation, a brief description can be provided within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory, to facilitate an accessible introduction.

You can visit [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view example documents.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams regarding this function, which may include the following content:

- Core Components: such as Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., illustrating the connections and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: such as introduced resources, dependencies among resources, and the process of resource consumption, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram explaining the meaning of the image and the role of each part contained within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts".
