# Architecture

![Source to Image Architecture](./assets/s2i-archtecture.png "Source to Image Architecture")

Source to Image (S2I) capability is implemented through the **Alauda Container Platform Builds** operator,
enabling automated container image builds from Git repository source code and subsequent pushes to a designated image registry. 
The core components include:

- **Alauda Container Platform Builds** operator: Manages the end-to-end build lifecycle and orchestrates Tekton pipelines.
- **Tekton** pipelines: Executes S2I workflows via Kubernetes-native `TaskRun` resources.
