# Architecture

![Source-to-Image Architecture](./assets/s2i-archtecture.png "Source-to-Image Architecture")

Source to Image functionality is implemented based on the ACP Builds component,
providing the capability to build images from Git repository source code and push them to the image repository.
The components are as follows:

- Alauda Builds: Manages the lifecycle of source code building and coordinates the Tekton component to execute source code building.

- Tekton: Provides TaskRun to execute Source to Image building and workflow execution.
