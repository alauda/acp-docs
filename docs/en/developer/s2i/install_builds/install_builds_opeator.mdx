# Installing Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds

## Prerequisites

> The Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds, hereinafter referred to as ACP Builds, is a container tool offered by the Alauda Container Platform (ACP) that integrates building (capable of Source to Image) and deployment.

1. Download the latest version installation package of ACP Builds that matches your platform. If the **Tekton Operator** has not been deployed on the platform, it is recommended to download it together.
2. Utilize the platform's application package management capability to list ACP Builds and Tekton installation packages on the platform, and distribute them to all clusters that require Source to Image capabilities. [Application package management capability](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/application/120_s2i/install/install_build.html)

## Steps

### Deploying the ACP Builds Operator

1. Log in to the platform and navigate to the **Platform Management** page.
2. In the left navigation bar, select **Application Store Management** -> **Operator** to enter the **Operator Hub** page.
3. Find the **ACP Builds Operator**, click **Deploy**, and enter the **Deploy ACP Builds Operator** page.

Configuration Parameters:

| **Parameter**   | **Recommended Configuration**                                                                |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Upgrade Policy** | `Manual`: When a new version is available in the Operator Hub, the **Upgrade** action will not be executed automatically, and you need to perform the **Upgrade** operation manually to upgrade the Operator to the new version. |
| **Deployment Mode** | `Cluster`: A single Operator is shared across all namespaces in the cluster for instance creation and management, resulting in lower resource usage.                          |
| **Channel**   | `Alpha`: The default Channel is set to **alpha**.                                        |
| **Namespace** | `Recommended Namespace`: It is recommended to use the **shipyard-operator** namespace; it will be created automatically if it does not exist.                          |

4. On the **Deploy Operator** page, select **Default Configuration**, click **Deploy**, and complete the deployment of the ACP Builds Operator.

### Deploying a Shipyard Instance

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Store Management** -> **Operators**.

2. In the **Deployed Operators** tab, click **shipyard-operator** (display name as **Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds**).

3. In the details section, click on the **Create Instance** button on the **Shipyard** instance card in the resource area.

4. On the parameter configuration page for the instance, you may use the default configuration unless there are specific requirements.

5. Click **Create**.

### Verification

- After the instance is successfully deployed, wait approximately "20 mins" before switching to "Container Platform" → Application Management → Native Applications → Create.
- You should see the entry for **Create through Code**. At this time, the deployment of Alauda Builds is successful, and you can start your Source to Image journey with the [Create Native Applications with Code](../how_to/s2i_howto.mdx).
