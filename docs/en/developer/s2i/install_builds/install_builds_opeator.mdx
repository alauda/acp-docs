# Installing Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds

## Prerequisites

> The Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds, hereinafter referred to as ACP Builds, is a container tool offered by the Alauda Container Platform (ACP) that integrates building (capable of Source to Image) and create application.

1. Download the latest version package of ACP Builds that matches your platform. If the **Tekton Operator** has not been deployed on the platform, it is recommended to download it together.
2. Utilize the platform's **Upload Packages** management capability to list ACP Builds and Tekton packages on the platform, and distribute them to all clusters that require Source to Image capabilities. [Upload Packages management capability](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/application/120_s2i/install/install_build.html)

## Procedure

### Install the ACP Builds Operator

1. Log in and navigate to the **Platform Management** page.
2. Click on **Application Store Management** -> **Operators** to enter the **OperatorHub** page.
3. Find the **ACP Builds Operator**, click **Install**, and enter the **Install Operator** page.

Configuration Parameters:

| **Parameter**   | **Recommended Configuration**                                                                |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Update approval** | `Manual`: When a new version is available in the Operator Hub, the **Upgrade** action will not be executed automatically, and you need to perform the **Upgrade** operation manually to upgrade the Operator to the new version. |
| **Installation mode** | `Cluster`: A single Operator is shared across all namespaces in the cluster for instance creation and management, resulting in lower resource usage.                          |
| **Channel**   | `Alpha`: The default Channel is set to **alpha**.                                        |
| **Namespace** | `Recommended Namespace`: It is recommended to use the **shipyard-operator** namespace; it will be created automatically if it does not exist.                          |

4. On the **Install Operator** page, select default configuration, click **Install**, and complete the installation of the ACP Builds Operator.

### Install a Shipyard instance

1. click on **Application Store Management** -> **Operators**.

2. In the **Installed Operators** tab, click **shipyard-operator** (display name as **Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds**).

3. Click on the **Create Instance** button on the **Shipyard** card in the resource area.

4. On the parameter configuration page for the instance, you may use the default configuration unless there are specific requirements.

5. Click **Create**.

### Verification

- After the instance is successfully creted, wait approximately "20 mins" before switching to **Container Platform** > **Application Management** > **Native Applications** and click on **Create**.
- You should see the entry for **Create from Code**. At this time, the installation of Alauda Builds is successful, and you can start your S2I journey with the [Create an application from code](../how_to/s2i_howto.mdx).
