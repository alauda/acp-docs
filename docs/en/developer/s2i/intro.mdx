# Introduction

Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds is a container tool provided by Alauda Container Platform (ACP) that integrates building (enabling Source to Image) and deployment.

## Source to Image Concept

Source to Image (S2I) is a tool and workflow for building reproducible container images from source code. It injects the applicationâ€™s source code into a predefined builder image and automatically completes steps such as compilation and packaging, ultimately generating a runnable container image. This allows developers to focus more on business code development without worrying about the details of containerization.

## Core Features

It facilitates a full-link process from code to application, enabling multi-language builds and visual releases. This helps developers quickly convert code into runnable container images and seamlessly integrates into a full-stack cloud-native open platform, ultimately achieving rapid release of business applications.

- Multi-language Build: Supports multiple programming languages such as Java, Go, Python, Node.js, etc., to meet diverse development needs.
- Visual Operations: Provides an intuitive interface for easy creation, configuration, and management of build tasks without needing to delve into underlying technologies.
- Full Lifecycle Management: Covers the entire process from code submission to application deployment, achieving automated builds, application deployment, and operational management.
- Deep Integration: Provides a seamless development experience with deep integration into Container Platform products.
- Highly Extensible: Supports custom plugins and extensions to meet personalized needs.

## Core Advantages

- Accelerated Development: Simplifies the build process and speeds up application delivery.
- Enhanced Flexibility: Supports building with various programming languages.
- Improved Efficiency: Automates building and deploying, reducing manual intervention.
- Enhanced Reliability: Provides detailed build logs and visual monitoring for easy problem troubleshooting.

## Application Scenarios

The main application scenarios for Source to Image are as follows:

- Web Application Development

  Supports various programming languages (such as Java, Go, Python, Node.js, etc.) and, through the platform application management capabilities, allows rapid building and deployment of business applications by simply entering the code repository address.

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

  By utilizing the platform application management capabilities, seamless integration with DevOps is achieved to implement automated image building and deployment processes.

## Usage Limitations

> The current version only supports Java, Go, Python, and Node.js languages.
