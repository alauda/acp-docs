# Introduction

**Alauda Container Platform Builds** is a cloud-native container tool provided by <Term name="product" textCase="capitalize" /> that integrates Source to Image (S2I) capabilities with automated pipelines. It accelerates enterprise cloud-native journeys by enabling fully automated CI/CD pipelines that support multiple programming languages, including Java, Go, Python, and Node.js. Additionally, Alauda Container Platform Builds offers visual release management and seamless integration with Kubernetes-native tools like Helm and GitOps, ensuring efficient application lifecycle management from development to production.

## Source to Image Concept

Source to Image (S2I) is a tool and workflow for building reproducible container images from source code. It injects the application’s source code into a predefined builder image and automatically completes steps such as compilation and packaging, ultimately generating a runnable container image. This allows developers to focus more on business code development without worrying about the details of containerization.

## Core Features

Alauda Container Platform Builds facilitates a full-stack, cloud-native workflow from code to application, enabling multi-language builds and visual release management. It leverages Kubernetes-native capabilities to convert source code into runnable container images, ensuring seamless integration into a comprehensive cloud-native platform. 

- **Multi-language Builds**: Supports building applications in various programming languages such as Java, Go, Python, and Node.js, accommodating diverse development needs.
- **Visual Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface that allows you to easily create, configure, and manage build tasks without deep technical knowledge.
- **Full Lifecycle Management**: Covers the entire lifecycle from code commit to application deployment, automating build, deployment, and operational management.
- **Deep Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your Container Platform product, providing a seamless development experience.
- **High Extensibility**: Supports custom plugins and extensions to meet your specific needs.

## Core Benefits
- **Accelerated Development**: Streamlines the build process, speeding up application delivery.
