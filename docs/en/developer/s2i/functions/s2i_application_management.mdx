# Managing applications created from Code

## Key Features

- Input the code repository URL to trigger the S2I process, which converts the source code into a image and publishes it as an application.
- When the source code is updated, initiate the **Rebuild** action via the visual interface to update the application version with a single click.

## Advantages

- Simplifies the process of creating and upgrading applications from code.
- Lowers the barrier for developers, eliminating the need to understand the details of containerization.
- Provides a visual construction process and operational management, facilitating problem localization, analysis, and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

- [Installing Alauda Container Platform Builds](../install_builds/install_builds_operator.mdx) is completed.
- Access to a image repository is required; if unavailable, contact the Administrator to [Installing Alauda Container Platform Registry](/developer/registry/install/index.mdx)

            Currently, only the **Build** method is supported for constructing
            application images. This method simplifies and automates the complex
            image building process, allowing developers to focus solely on code
            development. The general process is as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>
                After installed Alauda Container Platform Builds and creating the
                Shipyard instance, the system automatically generates cluster-level
                resources, such as ClusterBuildStrategy, and defines a standardized
                build process. This process includes detailed build steps and
                necessary build parameters, thereby enabling Source-to-Image (S2I)
                builds. For detailed information, refer to: [Installing Alauda
                Container Platform
                Builds](../install_builds/install_builds_operator.mdx)
              </li>
              <li>
                Create Build type resources based on the above strategies and the
                information provided in the form. These resources specify build
                strategies, build parameters, source code repositories, output image
                repositories, and other relevant information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create BuildRun type resources to initiate specific build instances,
                which coordinate the entire build process.
              </li>
              <li>
                After completing the BuildRun creation, the system will
                automatically generate the corresponding TaskRun resource instance.
                This TaskRun instance triggers the Tekton pipeline build and creates
                a Pod to execute the build process. The Pod is responsible for the
                actual build work, which includes: Pulling the source code from the
                code repository.
                <br />
                Calling the specified builder image.
