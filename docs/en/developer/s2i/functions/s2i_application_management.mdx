# Managing applications created from Code

## Key Features
- Input the code repository URL to trigger the S2I process, which converts the source code into a image and publishes it as an application.
- When the source code is updated, initiate the **Rebuild** action via the visual interface to update the application version with a single click.

## Advantages
- Simplifies the process of creating and upgrading applications from code.
- Lowers the barrier for developers, eliminating the need to understand the details of containerization.
- Provides a visual construction process and operational management, facilitating problem localization, analysis, and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the installation of [Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds](../install_builds/install_builds_opeator.mdx)
- Ensure that you have the relevant permissions.
- Access to a image repository is required; if unavailable, contact the Administrator to [Install Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Registry](../../image/install_registry.mdx)

This method simplifies and automates the complex image building process, allowing developers to focus solely on code development. The general process is as follows:<ol><li>After installing ACP Builds and creating the Shipyard instance, the system automatically generates cluster-level resources, such as ClusterBuildStrategy, and defines a standardized build process. This process includes detailed build steps and necessary build parameters, thereby enabling Source-to-Image (S2I) builds. For detailed information, refer to: [Install Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds](../install_builds/install_builds_opeator.mdx)</li><li>Create Build type resources based on the above strategies and the information provided in the form. These resources specify build strategies, build parameters, source code repositories, output image repositories, and other relevant information.</li><li>Create BuildRun type resources to initiate specific build instances, which coordinate the entire build process.</li><li>After completing the BuildRun creation, the system will automatically generate the corresponding TaskRun resource instance. This TaskRun instance triggers the Tekton pipeline build and creates a Pod to execute the build process. The Pod is responsible for the actual build work, which includes: Pulling the source code from the code repository.<br/>Calling the specified builder image.<br/>Executing the build process.</li></ol></td>
