# Creating Through Code

## Function Overview

Creating native applications through code is based on S2I (Source to Image) technology. S2I is an automated image building framework that can directly convert source code into runnable container images. This approach standardizes and automates the application building process, allowing developers to focus on business code development without worrying about the details of containerization.

## Key Features

- Input the code repository address to build the source code into a container image and publish it as an application.
- When the source code is updated, trigger the "Rebuild" action through the visual interface to update the application version with a single click.

## Advantages

- Simplifies the process of creating and upgrading applications from code.
- Lowers the barrier for developers, eliminating the need to understand the details of containerization.
- Provides a visual construction process and operational management, facilitating problem localization, analysis, and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the installation of [Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds](../install_builds/install_builds_opeator.mdx)
- Ensure that you have the relevant permissions.
- Access to a mirror repository; if unavailable, contact the platform administrator [Install Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Registry](../../image/install_registry.mdx)

## Operating Steps

1. Click on **Application Management** -> **Native Application** in the left navigation bar.

2. Click on **Create**.

3. Select the **Creating Through Code** option.

4. Refer to the parameter descriptions below to complete the configuration.

The general process is as follows: <ol><li>After installing the Alauda Builds Operator and deploying the Shipyard instance, the system will automatically generate cluster-level resources such as ClusterBuildStrategy and define a standardized building process, which includes detailed building steps and necessary building parameters, thus realizing S2I building. For detailed information, refer to: [Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds Installation](../install_builds/install_builds_opeator.mdx)</li><li>Create Build type resources based on the above strategies and the information filled in the form. This resource specifies build strategies, building parameters, source code repositories, output mirror repositories, and other information.</li><li>Create BuildRun type resources to start specific build instances, which coordinate the entire building process.</li><li>After completing the BuildRun creation, it will automatically generate the corresponding TaskRun resource instance, which triggers the Tekton pipeline build and creates a Pod to execute the build. The Pod is responsible for the actual build work, including: pulling the source code from the code repository, calling the specified builder image, executing the building process, and pushing the build results to the specified mirror repository.</li></ol></td>
