Introduce common issues that users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is limited, it can be placed directly on a single page titled "Troubleshooting." If there is more content, make "Troubleshooting" a directory, with each issue as a separate document.

You can visit the [Troubleshooting Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.

# \<Title: Generally the name of the issue>

## Issue Description

Provide a detailed account of the environment in which the issue occurs, its impact, and the symptoms of the issue, and appropriately add the following auxiliary information:

- Screenshot of the issue: Currently, it is recommended to use a text description. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots can be used, and users need to register the discussion with the documentation team.
- Related logs: Provide error messages, system logs, debug information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this issue (can be a single confirmed cause or multiple possible causes). For each cause, the following conditions must be met:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and has been confirmed to lead to this issue, rather than a conjectured or imagined cause.
2. Provide detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How this cause triggered the issue.
   - The specific mechanisms and processes involved in the occurrence of the issue.

## Troubleshooting (Optional)

List the specific steps for troubleshooting the issue in detail. Troubleshooting can help users identify the most likely or certain cause among multiple reasons and use appropriate solutions to resolve the issue. During troubleshooting, please note:

- If there is only one root cause, then troubleshooting steps should be provided in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes and the troubleshooting steps differ, use a third-level heading to list each root cause, and under each root cause, provide detailed troubleshooting steps.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, the second-level title should be “Solution”)

Specific notes, preconditions, and steps for resolving the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level title should be “Solution”; if there are multiple root causes and each has a different solution, each solution should be listed under its own second-level title, such as "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," etc.

### Precautions (Optional)

Items to note before starting operations. Failure to read this section carefully may result in operational failures or even more severe consequences.

### Preconditions (Optional)

Conditions that must be met before starting the operation steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level title can be omitted if there are no precautions or preconditions)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list format. If the steps are complicated, additional headings can be used to differentiate them, and a fourth-level heading should list each step, with specific steps presented in an ordered list format beneath it.
- If operations are conducted in a container platform, all steps should be detailed; if the operations take place on a third-party platform or other software, only the key steps should be specified.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if written too detailed, we cannot guarantee timely updates of the document when its interface changes, which may lead to many issues. To ensure the long-term usability of the document, the description of third-party platform operation steps should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Emphasize core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic process of operations.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level heading should be removed)

This section is consistent with the format of the solution for Root Cause 1 and will not be repeated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures (suggestions, commands, operations, preconditions, etc.) to prevent the recurrence of this issue.

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can contain material referenced in the document that is inconvenient to place in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
