:::tip

If the parent module requires manual upgrade operations, an upgrade document should be provided; otherwise, it may not be necessary.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade procedure, upgrade configuration, rollback procedure, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade procedures between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory, providing upgrade documents for different versions (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for examples of the corresponding document.
