:::tip

If the module needs to be deployed separately, deployment documentation needs to be provided; otherwise, it is not necessary.

The deployment documentation should include the deployment process, deployment configuration, uninstallation process, and so on. If the content of the deployment documentation is extensive, it can be reformatted into a directory, splitting it into multiple documents for explanation.

You can visit [Deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) to view an example of the corresponding documentation.
