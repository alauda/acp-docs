1. Overview

How-To documents are practical technical documentation focused on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. They combine product functionality with real-world application scenarios to provide users with comprehensive solution guidance.

2. Document Characteristics

How-To documents have the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios
- Highly practical: Directly answers the question, "How to achieve a certain goal," with an emphasis on practical operational guidance
- Comprehensive: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation
- Replicable: Users can follow the documented steps to reproduce solutions in similar scenarios

3. Writing Preparation

Before starting to write a How-To document, it is essential to clarify the following elements:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify specific user needs and pain points
- Determine the applicability of the solution
- Assess implementation conditions and potential limitations

Audience Targeting

- Identify the target readers (such as developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.)
- Evaluate the technical background and knowledge level of the readers
- Understand the readers' work scenarios and environments
