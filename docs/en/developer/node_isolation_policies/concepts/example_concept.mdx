Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional module (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.).
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document for multiple concept introductions. Conversely, it is recommended to introduce each concept in a separate document.
For obscure and complex concepts, it is advisable to write a standalone article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more accessible introduction.

You can visit the [concept document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) for corresponding document examples.
