1. What is the introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or functional modules, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and intended uses, offering readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We usually decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and overview of functions based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform-type products that include multiple core modules), it is advisable to separate these contents into individual documents; for single functional modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. The importance of the introduction

The topics covered by the product or functional module may be numerous, and adding an introduction at the beginning can help:

- Unified understanding: It can provide a consistent cognition as a preface, reducing communication errors.
- Guide reading: It provides the reader with a clear product background, facilitating deeper understanding of subsequent details.
- Improve efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repeatedly explaining fundamental product knowledge.

3. How to conceive this introduction section

- Concise and clear: Use straightforward language to summarize the core points of the product while avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight key points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functionalities of the product.
- Target the audience: Consider the background of the target audience and provide the information they care about.

4. The uniqueness of the introduction

This template offers a standardized framework for describing functional modules within documentation. By organizing content in a structured manner and using clear expressions, it helps teams better convey the functional value of the product, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product features.

We find that there are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of product-level introductions

- **Product positioning**: Clearly states the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete ecosystem**: Describes all core modules and functionality systems included in the product.
- **Applicable scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product will be more comprehensive, requiring a combined explanation based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of module-level introductions

- **Module positioning**: Explains the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module features**: Focuses on describing the features and advantages of the single module.
- **Applicable scenarios**: Emphasizes the supported applicable scenarios of the single module.
