# Quickly create a simple application via image

> This document provides guidance on how to quickly create, manage, and access applications in <Term name="product" textCase="capitalize" />.

## Introduction

### Applicable Scenarios

- You are a new user who has just started exploring the container platform and would like to quickly understand how to deploy a containerized web application to the platform and expose the service for external access.
- You want to learn the platform's basic functionalities through a simple and complete example, including: creating project, namespace, application, and exposing application services through internal routes.

### Estimated Reading Time
It is estimated that it will take 10-15 minutes to read and complete the steps described in this document.

## Notes

- This document does not provide detailed explanations or configurations for parameters during the configuration process. This document is intended as a quick start guide only. For specific explanations and configuration steps, please refer to the relevant documentation.
- You must have the necessary permissions to create project, namespace, and integrate image repositories.

## Prerequisites

- You have carefully read the platform overview and basic concepts documentation and have a basic understanding of the platform and its terminology.
- You have created a project by following the project creation documentation.

## Overview of the Process

| No. | Operation Steps                    |    Description|
| -- | ----------------------------------- | -----------------|
| 1  | [Create Namespace](#namespace)      | Create a namespace for isolating and managing resources for different applications. |
| 2  | [Obtain Image](#image)              | Before creating an application, obtain the image. The platform supports two ways to obtain images: **through an integrated image repository via toolchain** and **using third-party image repository services**. <br/>This document uses the open-source nginx image as an example. |
| 3  | [Create a simple application using Deployment](#deployment) | Create a simple application using deployment and the prepared image, and manage it accordingly. |
| 4  | [Expose application using Internal Route](#service)  | Expose the application service through an internal route.|
| 5  | [Access application](#application)  | Access the application through the port exposed by the internal route.|

## Operation Steps

### Create namespace \{#namespace}

A namespace is the foundation for implementing multi-tenancy, enabling the division of cluster resources into isolated user groups and the rational allocation of resources and application management based on the needs of different user groups. The steps to create a namespace are as follows:

**Prerequisites**

- You must have the necessary permissions to create, update, and delete namespaces (e.g., Administrator or Project Administrator roles).
- Use the platform's kubectl tool or a third-party CLI tool to connect to the control node of the cluster.

**Operation Steps**

1. Log in and navigate to the **Project Management** view.

2. click on **Project Management** > **Namespaces**.

3. Click on **Create Namespace**.

4. Configure the **Basic Information** based on the parameters below, keeping other parameters at their defaults.

   | Parameter      | Description                                                                                  |
   | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Cluster       | Select a cluster from the associated clusters in the project where the namespace will be created. |
   | Namespace     | Name of the namespace, automatically prefixed with the project name.                        |

5. Click on **Create**. A namespace without any resource usage restrictions is now successfully created.

### Obtain image \{#image}

Before creating an application, you need to obtain the container image. The platform supports the following two methods for acquiring images:

- Through an integrated image repository via toolchain.
- Using third-party image repository services is also supported.

#### Through integrated image repository via toolchain

1. Click on **Platform Management** > **Toolchain Management** > **Toolchain Integration**.

2. Click on **Integrate**.

3. After selecting a tool, configure the relevant parameters based on the description below.

   | Parameter      | Description                                                                                  |
   | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Integration Name | Enter the name of the integration tool; this name must not duplicate existing tool integration names. |
   | Access URL     | Enter the access URL of the tool.                                                       |
   | API Address    | Enter the service address of the integration tool. <br/>The address format is: HTTP/HTTPS protocol + IP + port or HTTP/HTTPS protocol + domain name. Public code repositories do not support modifying the default API address.|
   | Secret    | Select a pre-created Secret or add a new one.   |

5. Click on **Integrate**.

6. Click on the **created tools** card.

7. Click on the more options menu (⋮) next to the project name for the corresponding tool in the list, then select **Allocate Platform Project**.

8. Select the platform project you wish to use this tool project with.

9. Click on **Allocate**.

#### Using Third-party Image Repository Services

Ensure the image address can be accessed by the cluster; otherwise, it cannot be used properly.

### Create a simple application using Deployment \{#deployment}

Deployment is one of the most commonly used workloads, providing a declarative way to manage Pods. Through deployments, you can define the desired state of the application (e.g., number of replicas, container images, etc.). Deployments also enable rolling updates and rollbacks for applications, as well as automatic scaling and failure recovery of Pods.

#### Create application

1. Click on **Container Platform** view.

2. Click on the area behind the view name to select **Namespace**.

3. In the left navigation bar, click on **Workloads** > **Deployment**.

4. Click on **Create Deployment**.

5. Select the integrated image repository address via toolchain or input the third-party platform's image repository address, then click **Confirm**.

   **Note**: This document uses the open-source image nginx as an example `index.docker.io/library/nginx:latest`

6. Enter a name and click **Create**. At this point, a Deployment running nginx is successfully created.

#### Manage application

The running status, number of replicas, and other information of the application can be viewed on the details information page, where you can also manage the deployment and containers. You can also switch tabs to view application logs, monitoring, events, YAML, etc.

### Expose application using Service \{#service}

Internal routes enable service discovery for workloads by providing a unified IP address or host port for access.

1. Click on **Network** > **Service**.

2. Click on **Create Service**.

3. Configure the **Details** based on the parameters below, keeping other parameters at their defaults.

   | Parameter        | Description                                                       |
   | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Name             | Enter the name of the Service.   |
   | Type             | `NodePort`   |
   | Workload Name   | Select the `Deployment` created previously.               |
   | Port             | **Service Port**: The port number exposed by the Service within the cluster, i.e., Port, e.g., `8080`.<br/>**Container Port**: The target port number (or name) mapped by the service port, i.e., targetPort, e.g., `80`.|

4. Click on **Create**. At this point, the Service is successfully created.

### Access Application \{#application}

1. Enter the details page of the Service.

2. Copy the **Node IP Address** from the Pod section.

3. Copy the **Host Port** from the port section.

4. Enter `<Node IP Address>:<Port>` in your browser to successfully access the application. In this document, the Node IP Address is 192.1.1.3 and the Node Port is 31217, as shown in the following figure.
