# Features

## Building Application

- Creating Application

  Support multiple ways to create an Application, including image, yaml, codes and catalog.

- Application Operation

  Use Application to orchestrate and operate the workloads and their related resources.

- Workloads Management

  Manage the lifecycle of the workloads.

## Namespace Management

- Namespace Lifecycle Management

  Manage the lifecycle of the namespace.

- Resource Quota and Limit Management

  Manage the resource quota and limit of the namespace.

- Namespace Resource Overcommit

  Allow overcommit the reousurce of the namespace.

## Application Observability

- Logs

  Query the history logs or real time logs of the applications.

- Events

  Query the events collected from the applications.

- Monitoring

  Monitor the application status and firing alerts when abnormalities occur.

## OAM Application

- Efficient operation and maintenance

  Through OAM applications, application operation and maintenance personnel can focus on business logic and manage applications from the application perspective rather than the platform perspective, reducing the threshold for application operation and maintenance. Platform operation and maintenance personnel can handle platform plugins, operation and maintenance plugins, and other configurations uniformly, thereby improving operational efficiency.

- Portability

  The OAM application model includes configurations related to application operation and maintenance, service governance, etc. Compared with applications deployed through Operators, Charts, and other methods, OAM applications can be repeatedly deployed through YAML, making cross-environment migration easier. Even without Kubernetes and specific vendors, OAM applications can run normally on various platforms.

- Scalability

  Several types of components pre-installed on the platform can meet most application development needs: network services, stateful applications, and native Kubernetes resources. In addition, the platform also provides the ability to extend components and traits, making it easy for developers to use custom-designed and encapsulated components and traits.

## Source to Image

- Build image from source

  Build image from the source code of the git repository and push the image to the image repository.

## Registry

- Out-of-the-box Registry Server

  Easily deploy an registry server available for the platform.

## Node Isolation Strategy

- Node Isolation

  Support project-level node isolation to avoid resource contention between projects.
