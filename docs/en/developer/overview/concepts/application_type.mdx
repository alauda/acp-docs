# Application Types

In the platform's **Container Platform > Application Management**, the following types of applications can be created:

- **Application**: A complete business application composed of one or more associated computing components (Workloads), internal routes (Services), and other native Kubernetes resources. It supports creation through UI editing, YAML orchestration, and templates, and can run in development, testing, or production environments. Different types of native applications can be created in the following ways:
  - **Create from Image**: Quickly create applications using existing container images.
  - **Create from Catalog**: Create applications using Helm Chart packages.
  - **Create from YAML**: Create applications using YAML configuration files.
  - **Create from Code**: Create applications using source code.
- **Operator Backed App**: Based on application components (Operator backed), you can quickly deploy a component application and leverage the capabilities of Operators to automate the entire lifecycle management of the application.
- **OAM Application**: Used to define the model of cloud-native applications. Compared to container or Kubernetes orchestration logic, OAM focuses more on the "application" itself. Based on OAM, common capabilities of applications are encapsulated into high-level interfaces for use, throughout the entire process of application deployment, development, and operations.
