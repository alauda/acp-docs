1. What is an introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or feature modules, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and expected uses, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

We generally determine whether to combine the introduction, advantages, and feature overview sections into a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products containing multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into individual documents; for single feature modules, they can be merged into the same document.

2. The importance of introductions

Given the many points involved in a product or feature module, adding an introduction can:

- Unified understanding: It can provide a consistent cognition at the beginning, reducing communication errors.
- Guide reading: It provides a clear background of the product for readers, facilitating a deeper understanding of the detailed content that follows.
- Improve efficiency: It minimizes the time spent on repetitive explanations regarding the basic understanding of the product.

3. How to conceptualize the introduction section

- Concise and clear: Summarize the core points of the product in concise language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight key points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main features of the product.
- Audience-focused: Consider the background of the target readers and provide information that concerns them.

4. The uniqueness of the introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in the document. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the value of product features, enabling users to quickly understand and use product functions.

There are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of product-level introductions:

- **Product positioning**: Clearly state the product's position and competitive advantages in the industry.
- **Complete ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive, requiring a combined explanation based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of module-level introductions:

- **Module positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of this module within the product.
- **Module characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the single module.
- **Applicable scenarios**: Emphasize supported scenarios of the single module.
