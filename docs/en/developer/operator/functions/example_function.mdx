When drafting functionality documentation, the person responsible for each feature should reasonably split the document pages and directory structure based on the specific characteristics of the functions. Prioritize providing corresponding CLI operation instructions to assist users in getting started quickly.

1. Overview

Functionality guideline documents are typically situated between feature overviews and HowTo documents, focusing on a detailed introduction of a single function. It can cover a thorough description of the feature itself.

2. Core Characteristics

Functionality guideline documents should possess the following core characteristics:

- Concept-driven: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the function.
- Flexibility: Function descriptions should not rely on specific scenarios.
- Detailed CLI: Prioritize providing detailed command line operation instructions to help users quickly implement functionality via CLI. Then supplement with the corresponding usage methods of the functionality interface.

3. Differences Between Function Documentation and HowTo Documents

Function documentation often includes some usage and operational introductions, but the differences between it and HowTo can be perplexing. Their distinctions are:

- **Content Focus**
  - Function Guide: Answers "what" and "why," helping users understand the function itself.
  - HowTo: Answers "how to do," guiding users to complete specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Function Guide: A systematic, hierarchically structured knowledge system emphasizing concept explanation and principle elaboration.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear steps emphasizing practical guidance.

- **Use Cases**
  - Function Guide: For users who are first getting to know the function or need to understand the underlying principles.
  - HowTo: When users need to solve specific problems or complete particular tasks.

- **Coverage Scope**
  - Function Guide: Fully introduces all features, configuration items, and usage methods of the function.
  - HowTo: A specific operational guide for a single scenario or task.

4. Writing Guidelines

When writing functionality documentation, especially concerning the CLI section, it is recommended to follow these steps:

- Identify the target user group: Determine the target audience for the document and their needs. Understand their familiarity with the CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content.
- Structure content: Divide the document into multiple sections, such as feature introduction, detailed CLI command parameters, usage examples, and cautions. Ensure each part is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed command explanation: For each CLI command, provide detailed parameter explanations and usage examples. Explain the commandâ€™s purpose, applicable scenarios, and possible output results.
