:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Architectural Framework" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Concepts introduced in the architecture are recommended to be linked to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" below. If a concept introduced is relatively simple and does not require a separate documentation explanation, a brief description can be provided in the architectural document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to explain in a more accessible way.

You can visit the [example architectural document](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view sample documents.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams of the feature, which can include the following content:

- Core components: such as Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., and depict the relationships and functions of each component in the diagram.
- Data flow: such as introduced resources, inter-resource dependencies, and the process of resource consumption, etc.
- Deployment architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description of the image below the architecture diagram, explaining the significance of the image and the functions of each part within it.

Briefly introduce the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts."
