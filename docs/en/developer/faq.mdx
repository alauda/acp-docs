## Why shouldn't multiple ResourceQuotas exist in a namespace when importing it?

When importing a namespace, if the namespace contains multiple ResourceQuota resources, the platform will select the smallest value for each quota item among all ResourceQuotas and merge them, ultimately creating a single ResourceQuota named `default`.

Example:

The namespace `to-import` to be imported contains the following `resourcequota` resources:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: a
  namespace: to-import
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: "500Mi"
    limits.cpu: "3"
    limits.memory: "1Gi"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: b
  namespace: to-import
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: "300Mi"
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: "2Gi"
```

After importing the `to-import` namespace, the following `default` ResourceQuota will be created in that namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: to-import
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "1"
    requests.memory: "300Mi"
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: "1Gi"
```

For each ResourceQuota, the quotas of resources is the minimum value between `a` and `b`.

When multiple ResourceQuotas exist in a namespace, Kubernetes validates each ResourceQuota independently. Therefore, after importing a namespace, it is recommended to delete all ResourceQuotas except for the `default` one. This helps avoid complications in quota calculations due to multiple ResourceQuotas, which can easily lead to errors.

## Why shouldn't multiple LimitRanges exist in a namespace when importing it?

When importing a namespace, if the namespace contains multiple LimitRange resources, the platform cannot merge them into a single LimitRange. Since Kubernetes independently validates each LimitRange when multiple exist, and the behavior of which LimitRange's default values Kubernetes selects is unpredictable.

If the namespace only contains a single LimitRange, the platform will created a LimitRange named `default` with the values from that LimitRange.

Therefore, before importing a namespace, only a single LimitRange should exist in the namespace. And after the namespace is imported it is recommended to delete the LimitRanges except for the one named `default` to avoid unpredictable behavior caused by multiple LimitRanges.
