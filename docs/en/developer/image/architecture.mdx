:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Function Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Concepts introduced in the architecture should ideally link to the corresponding sections in the "Core Concepts" chapter below. If the introduced "concept" is relatively simple and does not require a separate document for explanation, it can be briefly described within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory to provide a more comprehensive introduction.

You can access the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view a sample document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams for this functionality, which may include the following contents:

- Core Components: such as Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., and illustrate the relationships and roles between each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: such as the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the processes of resource consumption.
- Deployment Architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high-availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram, explaining the meaning of the image and the roles of its various parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts."
