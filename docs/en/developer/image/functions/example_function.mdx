When writing feature documentation, each feature owner should reasonably split the document pages and directory structure based on the specific characteristics of the feature. Priority should be given to providing the corresponding CLI operation instructions to help users get started quickly.

1. Overview

Feature guide documentation usually sits between the feature overview and HowTo documents, focusing on a detailed introduction of a single feature. It can cover a detailed description of the feature itself.

2. Core Characteristics

Feature guide documentation should possess the following core characteristics:

- Concept-driven: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the feature.
- Flexibility: Can describe the feature without relying on specific scenarios.
- CLI details: Prioritize providing detailed command line operation instructions to assist users in quickly utilizing the feature through CLI. Supplement this with the usage of the corresponding feature interface.

3. Differences Between Feature Documentation and HowTo Documentation

Feature documentation often includes some introductions to usage and operations, but the differences from HowTo can often be confusing. The distinctions are as follows:

- **Content Focus**
  - Feature Guide: Answers "what it is" and "why," helping users understand the feature itself.
  - HowTo: Answers "how to," guiding users in completing specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Feature Guide: A systematic, hierarchical knowledge system that focuses on concept explanation and principle elaboration.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear operational steps, emphasizing practical guidance.

- **Usage Scenarios**
  - Feature Guide: When users are first learning about the feature or need to understand the principles of the feature in depth.
  - HowTo: When users need to solve specific problems or complete specific tasks.

- **Coverage**
  - Feature Guide: Provides a complete introduction to all features, configuration options, and usage methods of the functionality.
  - HowTo: A specific operational guide for a single scenario or task.

4. Writing Guidelines

When drafting feature documentation, especially for CLI-related sections, it is recommended to follow these steps:

- Identify target user group: Define the target readers of the document and their needs. Understand their familiarity with CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content accordingly.
- Structure content: Divide the document into multiple sections, such as feature introduction, detailed CLI command parameters, usage examples, and notes. Ensure each section is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed command explanations: Provide detailed parameter explanations and usage examples for each CLI command. Explain the command's role, applicable scenarios, and possible output results.
