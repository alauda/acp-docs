Introduce common problems and solutions that users may encounter. If the content is short, it can be placed directly on the "Troubleshooting" single page; if the content is extensive, use the "Troubleshooting" as a directory, with each problem as a separate document.

You can visit the [Troubleshooting Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to view an example of the corresponding document.

# \<Title: Generally the Problem's Name>

## Problem Description

Detail the environment in which the problem occurs, its scope of impact, and the symptoms of the issue, while appropriately including the following supplementary information:

- Problem Screenshots: Text descriptions are currently preferred. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used, and users need to register for discussion with the documentation team.
- Relevant Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this problem (it could be a single confirmed cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause must meet the following criteria:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and been confirmed to lead to the problem, rather than an assumed or speculative cause.
2. A detailed causal analysis is required, including:
   - How the cause triggers the issue.
   - The specific mechanism and process by which the problem occurs.

## Problem Diagnosis (Optional)

List the specific steps for diagnosing the problem. By troubleshooting, users can select the most likely or definitive cause among several possibilities and utilize appropriate solutions to resolve the issue. In problem diagnosis, note the following:

- If there is only one root cause, diagnostic steps need to be provided. In this case, itâ€™s recommended to use a numbered list format for display.

  ```
  1. Diagnostic Step 1
  ...
  n. Diagnostic Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different diagnostic steps, use a tertiary heading format to list each root cause, and under each root cause, provide detailed diagnostic steps.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Diagnostic Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnostic Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Diagnostic Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnostic Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level heading should be named "Solution")

Specific precautions, prerequisites, and operational steps for resolving this issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, then the second-level heading should be "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes, and each root cause has a different solution, then each solution should be presented under its own second-level heading, named "Solution for Root Cause 1", "Solution for Root Cause N", etc.

### Precautions (Optional)

Precautions that need to be taken before starting operations. Failing to carefully read this section may lead to operational failures or even more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that need to be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This tertiary heading can be omitted if there are no precautions or prerequisites)

- Operational steps are usually presented in a numbered list format. If the operational steps are more complicated, additional titles can be added between multiple steps for differentiation, and then use a fourth-level heading format to list each step, with specific steps presented as a numbered list under each.
- If operations are performed on a container platform, a detailed account of each operational step should be provided; if on a third-party platform or other software, just provide the key steps.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if written in excessive detail, we cannot ensure the document will be promptly updated when its interface changes, which may lead to many issues. To ensure the long-term usability of the documentation, the descriptions of operational steps on third-party platforms should adhere to the following principles:
  >
  > - Highlight core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic flow of operations.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level heading should be removed)

This section will have the same format as the solution for Root Cause 1 and will not be discussed again.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of this problem (recommendations, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

This can house content that is referenced in the document but not convenient to include in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
