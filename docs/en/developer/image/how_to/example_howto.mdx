1. Overview

HowTo documents are practical technical documents focused on addressing specific problems in particular scenarios. They combine product features with real-world use cases to provide users with complete guidance for solutions.

2. Document Features

HowTo documents have the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios
- High practicality: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a certain goal," emphasizing practical operational guidance
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation
- Replicability: Users can replicate the solutions in similar scenarios by following the document's steps

3. Writing Preparation

Before creating HowTo documents, it is important to clarify the following elements:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify the specific needs and pain points of users
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution
- Assess implementation conditions and possible constraints

Audience Targeting

- Define the target readers (such as developers, operation and maintenance personnel, system administrators, etc.)
- Assess the technical background and knowledge level of the readers
- Understand the readers' work scenarios and environment
