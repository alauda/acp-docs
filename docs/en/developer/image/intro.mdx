1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section is the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and expected use cases, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

We generally decide whether to combine the Introduction, Advantages, and Feature Overview sections into a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products containing multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be merged into the same document.

2. Importance of Introduction

There might be many aspects involved in a product or functional module. Adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: It can serve as a starting point to provide a consistent understanding, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: It provides readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of the subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repeating explanations of the product's foundational understanding.

3. How to Construct the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main functionalities.
- Audience-Oriented: Consider the background of the target readers and provide the information they care about.

4. The Uniqueness of Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documents. By structuring content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the product's functional value, allowing users to quickly understand and use product features.

We can find some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product are more comprehensive and need to be described in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Describe the role and responsibilities of this module in the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the supported applicable scenarios of a single module.
