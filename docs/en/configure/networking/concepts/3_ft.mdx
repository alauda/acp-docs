# ALB Frontend

We define a resource called frontend (abbreviated as ft), which is used to declare all the ports that all the alb should listen to.

```yaml
apiVersion: crd.alauda.io/v1
kind: Frontend
metadata:
  labels:
    alb2.cpaas.io/name: alb-demo # required, indicate the ALB instance to which this Frontend belongs to
  name: alb-demo-00080           # format as $alb_name-$port
spec:
  backendProtocol: "http"
  certificate_name: ""  # format as $secret_ns/$secret_name
  port: 80              
  protocol: http        # protocol of this Frontend itself. http|https|grpc|grpcs for l7 proxy. tcp|udp for l4 proxy
  serviceGroup:         # could be multiple services.
    services:
    - name: hello-world
      namespace: default
      port: 80
      weight: 100
```

## As L4 proxy

For l4 proxy, serviceGroup is required.

## As L7 proxy

For l7 proxy, serviceGroup is optional. When a request arrives, ALB will first try to match it against rules associated with this Frontend. Only if the request doesn't match any rule, ALB will then forward it to the default serviceGroup specified in the Frontend configuration.
