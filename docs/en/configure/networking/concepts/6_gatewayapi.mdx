# GatewayAPI

[GatewayAPI](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) is a new standard for Kubernetes ingress.

ALB supports GatewayAPI as well. Each Gateway resource will be translated into an ALB resource.

Listener and Router will be handled in ALB directly. They will not be translated into Frontend and Rule.
