# Subnet Management

## Managing Kube-OVN Networks\{#ovn}

Manage subnets under the Kube-OVN network, including Underlay and Overlay transportation networks.

### Updating Gateway

This includes changing the outbound traffic method, gateway nodes, and NAT configuration.

1. Navigate to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left sidebar, click on **Network Management** > **Subnets**.

3. Click the name of the subnet.

4. Select **Action** > **Update Gateway**.

5. Update the parameter configurations; refer to the [Parameter Description](./subnet_kubeovn_overlay.mdx) for details.

6. Click **OK**.

### Updating Reserved IPs

The gateway IP cannot be removed from the reserved IPs, while other reserved IPs can be edited, deleted, or added freely.

1. Navigate to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left sidebar, click on **Network Management** > **Subnets**.

3. Click the name of the subnet.

4. Select **Action** > **Update Reserved IP**.

5. After completing the updates, click **Update**.

### Assigning Projects

Assigning subnets to specific projects helps teams better manage and isolate network traffic for different projects, ensuring that each project has sufficient network resources.

1. Navigate to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left sidebar, click on **Network Management** > **Subnets**.

3. Click the name of the subnet.

4. Select **Action** > **Assign Project**.

5. After adding or removing projects, click **Assign**.

### Assigning Namespaces

Assigning subnets to specific namespaces allows for finer network isolation.

**Note**: The assignment process will rebuild the gateway, and outbound data packets will be discarded! Please ensure no business applications are currently accessing external clusters.

1. Navigate to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left sidebar, click on **Network Management** > **Subnets**.

3. Click the name of the subnet.

4. Select **Action** > **Assign Namespace**.

5. After adding or removing namespaces, click **Assign**.

### Expanding Subnets

When the reserved IP range of a subnet reaches its usage limit or is about to be exhausted, it can be expanded based on the original subnet range without affecting the normal operation of existing services.

1. Navigate to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left sidebar, click on **Network Management** > **Subnets**.

3. Click the name of the subnet.

4. Select **Action** > **Expand Subnet**.

5. Complete the configuration and click **Update**.
