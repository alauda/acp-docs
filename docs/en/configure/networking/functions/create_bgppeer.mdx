# Creating BGP Peers

Nodes that establish connections to exchange routing information either between different AS or within the same AS, which communicate via the BGP protocol.

| **AS Number** | AS refers to a collection of routers managed by the same technical administrative organization that use a unified routing policy. Each AS in a BGP network is assigned a unique AS number to distinguish it from different ASs. AS numbers are divided into 2-byte AS numbers and 4-byte AS numbers. <ul><li>The range of 2-byte AS numbers is 1~65535, where 1\~64511 are registered public AS numbers on the Internet, similar to public IP addresses; 64512\~65535 are private AS numbers, similar to private IP addresses.</li><li>The range of 4-byte AS numbers is 1\~4294967295.</li></ul> Devices that support 4-byte AS numbers can be compatible with devices that support 2-byte AS numbers. |

## Prerequisites

Please contact the administrator to enable the relevant features.

   | Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Local AS Number**    | The AS number of the AS where the BGP connected node resides.<br /><br /><b>Note</b>: If there are no special requirements, it is recommended to use an IBGP configuration, meaning the local AS number should be consistent with the peer AS number.                                                              |
   | **Peer AS Number**     | The AS number of the AS where the BGP peer resides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | **Peer IP**            | The IP address of the BGP peer, which must be a valid IP address capable of establishing a BGP connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   | **Local IP**           | The IP address of the BGP connected node. When the BGP connected node has multiple IPs, select the specified local IP to establish a BGP connection with the peer.                                                                                                                                                 |
   | **Peer Port**          | The port number of the BGP peer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | **BGP Connected Node** | The node that establishes the BGP connection. If this parameter is not configured, all nodes will establish BGP connections.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
   | **eBGP Multi-Hop**     | Allows the establishment of BGP sessions between BGP routers that are not directly connected. When this feature is enabled, the default TTL value of BGP packets is 5, allowing the establishment of BGP peer relationships across multiple intermediate network devices, making network design more flexible.     |
   | **RouterID**           | A 32-bit numeric value (usually represented in dotted-decimal format, similar to IPv4 address format) used to uniquely identify a BGP router in the BGP network, generally used for establishing BGP neighbor relationships, detecting routing loops, selecting optimal paths, and troubleshooting network issues. |

5. Click **Create**.
