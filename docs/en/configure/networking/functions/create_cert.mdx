# Creating Certificates

After the platform administrator imports the TLS certificate and assigns it to a specified project, developers with corresponding project permissions can use the certificate imported and assigned by the platform administrator when using inbound rules and load balancing functionalities. Subsequently, in scenarios such as certificate expiration, the platform administrator can update the certificate centrally.

:::note
The certificate functionality is currently not supported for use in public cloud clusters. You can create TLS type secret dictionaries as needed within the specified namespace.

## Creating a certificate by using the web console

1. Go to **Administrator**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network Management** > **Certificates**.

3. Click **Create Certificate**.

   | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Assign Project** | <ul><li>All Projects: Assign the certificate for use in all projects associated with the current cluster.</li><li>Specified Project: Assign the certificate for use in the specified project.</li><li>No Assignment: Do not assign a project for now. After the certificate creation is completed, you can update the projects that can use the certificate through the **Update Project** operation.</li></ul> |
   | **Public Key**     | This refers to tls.crt. When importing the public key, binary files are not supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | **Private Key**    | This refers to tls.key. When importing the private key, binary files are not supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
