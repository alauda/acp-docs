# Configure Domain

Add domain name resources to the platform and allocate domains for use by all projects under a cluster or resources under a specific project. When creating a domain name, binding a certificate is supported.

:::note
The domain names created on the platform should be resolved to the cluster's load balancing address before they can be accessed via the domain name. Therefore, you need to ensure that the domain names added on the platform have been successfully registered and that the domain names resolve to the cluster's load balancing address.
:::

Successfully created and allocated domain names on the platform can be utilized in the following features of **Container Platform**:

- **Create Inbound Rules**: **Network Management** > **Inbound Rules** > **Create Inbound Rule**

- **Create Native Applications**: **Application Management** > **Native Applications** > **Create Native Application** > **Add Inbound Rule**

- **Add Listening Ports** for Load Balancing: **Network Management** > **Load Balancer Details** > **Add Listening Port**

Once the domain name is bound to a certificate, application developers can simply select the domain name when configuring the load balancer and inbound rules, allowing the use of the certificate that comes with the domain name for https support.

## Example Domain custom resource (CR)

```yaml
# test-domain.yaml
apiVersion: crd.alauda.io/v2
kind: Domain
metadata:
  name: '00000000003075575260129686e67ed4-917a-454a-8553-d55fc4030f81'
  annotations:
    cpaas.io/secret-ref: developer.test.cn-xfd8x # [!code callout]
  labels:
    cluster.cpaas.io/name: global
    project.cpaas.io/name: cong
spec:
  name: developer.test.cn
  kind: full
```

<Callouts>

1. If certificates are enabled, an LTS-type Secret must be created in advance. The `secret-ref` is secret name.

   | **Certificate**      | Includes the public key (tls.crt) and private key (tls.key) for creating a domain name-bound certificate. The project to which the certificate is allocated is the same as the bound domain name.<br />**Notes**: <ul><li>Binary file imports are not supported.</li><li>The bound certificate should meet the conditions of correct format, within the validity period, and signed for the domain name, etc.</li><li>After creating the bound certificate, the name format of the bound certificate is: domain name - random characters.</li><li>After creating the bound certificate, the bound certificate can be viewed in the certificate list, but updates and deletions of the bound certificate are only supported on the domain detail page.</li><li>After creating the bound certificate, updating the certificate content is supported, but replacing other certificates is not supported.</li></ul> |

5. Click **Create**.

## Creating Domain by using the CLI

```shell
kubectl apply -f test-domain.yaml
```

## Subsequent Actions

- **Domain Registration**: Register the domain if the created domain has not been registered.

- **Domain Resolution**: Perform domain resolution if the domain does not point to the platform cluster's load balancing address.
