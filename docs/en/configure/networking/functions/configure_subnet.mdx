# Configure Subnets

## IP Allocation Rules

:::note
If a project or namespace is assigned multiple subnets, an IP address will be randomly selected from one of the subnets.
:::

- Project Allocation:

  - If a project is not bound to a subnet, Pods in all namespaces under that project can only use IP addresses from the default subnet. If there are insufficient IP addresses in the default subnet, the Pods will not be able to start.
  - If a project is bound to a subnet, Pods in all namespaces under that project can only use IP addresses from that specific subnet.

- Namespace Allocation:

  - If a namespace is not bound to a subnet, Pods in that namespace can only use IP addresses from the default subnet. If there are insufficient IP addresses in the default subnet, the Pods will not be able to start.
  - If a namespace is bound to a subnet, Pods in that namespace can only use IP addresses from that specific subnet.

## Calico Network

Creating subnets in the Calico network to achieve finer granularity of network isolation for resources within the cluster.

### Constraints and Limitations

In an IPv6 cluster environment, the subnets created within the Calico network, by default, use VXLAN encapsulation. The ports required for VXLAN encapsulation differ from those of IPIP encapsulation. You need to ensure that UDP port 4789 is open.

### Example Subnet custom resource (CR) with Calico Network

```yaml
# test-calico-subnet.yaml
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: test-calico
spec:
  cidrBlock: 10.1.1.1/24
  default: false #[!code callout]
  ipipMode: Always #[!code callout]
  natOutgoing: true #[!code callout]
  private: false
  protocol: Dual
  v4blockSize: 30
```

<Callouts>

1. When `default` If true, use VXLAN encapsulation.
2. See Encapsulation Mode parameters and Encapsulation Protocol parameters.
3. See Outbound Traffic NAT parameters.

</Callouts>

### Creating a Subnet in the Calico network by using the web console

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network Management** > **Subnets**.

3. Click **Create Subnet**.

4. Refer to the following instructions to configure the relevant parameters.

   | **Network Segment**      | After assigning the subnet to the project or namespace, IPs within this segment will be randomly allocated for use by Pods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | **Reserved IP**          | The set reserved IP will not be automatically allocated. For example, it can be used as the IP address for computing components' **fixed IP**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | **Gateway Type**         | Select the type of gateway for the subnet to control the outbound traffic. <br />- **Distributed**: Each host in the cluster can act as an outbound node for Pods on the current host, enabling distributed egress. <br />- **Centralized**: All Pods in the cluster use one or more specific hosts as outbound nodes, facilitating external auditing and firewall control. Setting multiple centralized **gateway nodes** can achieve high availability.                                                                                     |
   | **ECMP (Alpha)**         | When choosing a **Centralized** gateway, the ECMP feature can be used. By default, the gateway operates in master-slave mode, with only the master gateway processing traffic. When enabling ECMP (Equal-Cost Multipath Routing), outbound traffic will be routed through multiple equal-cost paths to all available gateway nodes, thereby increasing the total throughput of the gateway. <br /><br />**Note**: Please enable ECMP-related features in advance.                                                                             |
   | **Gateway Nodes**        | When using a **Centralized** gateway, select one or more specific hosts as gateway nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
   | **Outbound Traffic NAT** | Choose whether to enable outbound traffic NAT (Network Address Translation). By default, it is enabled. <br />It is mainly used to set the access address exposed to the external network when the Pods in the subnet access the internet. <br />When outbound traffic NAT is enabled, the host IP will be used as the access address for the Pods in the current subnet; when not enabled, the IPs of the Pods within the subnet will be directly exposed to the external network. In this case, using a centralized gateway is recommended. |

### Underlay Network \{#kube_ovn_underlay_network}

Creating subnets in the Kube-OVN Underlay network not only enables finer-grained network isolation for resources but also provides a better performance experience.

:::info
The container network in Kube-OVN Underlay requires support from the physical network. Please refer to the best practices [Preparing the Kube-OVN Underlay Physical Network](../how_to/kubeovn_underlay_py.mdx) to ensure network connectivity.
:::

### Usage Instructions

The general process for creating subnets in the Kube-OVN Underlay network is: Add Bridge Network > Add VLAN > Create Subnet.

<Callouts>

1. Default Network Card Name.
2. Configure Network Card by Node.

</Callouts>

### Add Bridge Network by using the web console (Optional) \{#kube-ovn_underlay_bridge_network}

```yaml
# test-provider-network.yaml
kind: ProviderNetwork
apiVersion: kubeovn.io/v1
metadata:
  name: test-provider-network
spec:
  defaultInterface: eth1 #[!code callout]
  customInterfaces: #[!code callout]
    - interface: eth2
      nodes:
        - node1
  excludeNodes:
    - node2
```

<Callouts>

1. Default Network Card Name.
2. Configure Network Card by Node.

</Callouts>

A bridge network refers to a bridge, and after binding the network card to the bridge, it can forward container network traffic, achieving intercommunication with the physical network.

Procedure:

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network Management** > **Bridge Network**.

3. Click **Add Bridge Network**.

4. Configure the relevant parameters based on the following instructions.

   **Note**:

   - _Target Pod_ refers to all Pods scheduled on the current node or Pods in namespaces bound to specific subnets scheduled to the current node. This depends on the scope of the subnet under the bridge network.

   - The nodes in the Underlay subnet must have multiple network cards, and the network card used by the bridge network must be exclusively assigned to the Underlay and cannot carry other traffic, such as SSH. For example, if the bridge network has three nodes planning for eth0, eth0, eth1 for exclusive use by the Underlay, then the default network card can be set as eth0, and the network card for node three can be eth1.

   | Parameter                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
   | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Default Network Card Name**      | By default, the target Pod will use this as the bridge network card for intercommunication with the physical network.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | **Configure Network Card by Node** | The target Pods on the configured nodes will bridge to the specified network card instead of the default network card.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | **Exclude Nodes**                  | When nodes are excluded, all Pods scheduled to these nodes will not bridge to any network card on these nodes.<br /><br />**Note**: Pods on excluded nodes will not be able to communicate with the physical network or cross-node container networks, and care should be taken to avoid scheduling related Pods to these nodes. |

5. Click **Add**.

### Add Bridge Network by using the CLI

```shell
kubectl apply -f test-provider-network.yaml
```

### Add VLAN by using the web console (Optional)

```yaml
# test-vlan.yaml

### Creating a Subnet in the Kube-OVN Underlay Network by using the web console

:::note
The platform also pre-configures a **join** subnet for communication between nodes and Pods in Overlay transport mode. This subnet will not be used in Underlay transport mode, so it is crucial to avoid IP segment conflicts between **join** and other subnets.
:::

Procedure:

1. Navigate to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network Management** > **Subnet**.

3. Click **Create Subnet**.

4. Configure the relevant parameters based on the following instructions.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                 |
   | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **VLAN**        | The VLAN to which the subnet belongs.                                                                                                       |
   | **Subnet**      | After assigning the subnet to a project or namespace, IPs within the physical subnet will be randomly allocated for use by Pods.            |
   | **Gateway**     | The physical gateway within the above subnet.                                                                                               |
   | **Reserved IP** | The specified reserved IP will not be automatically assigned. For example, it can be used as the IP for the compute component **fixed IP**. |

5. Click **Confirm**.

6. On the subnet details page, select **Action** > **Assign Project** / **Namespace**.

7. Complete the configuration and click **Assign**.

6. Click **OK**.

### Updating Gateway by using the CLI

```shell
kubectl patch subnet test-overlay-subnet --type=json -p='[
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/gatewayType", "value": "centralized"},
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/gatewayNode", "value": "192.168.66.210"},
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/natOutgoing", "value": true},
  {"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/enableEcmp", "value": true}
]'
```

### Updating Reserved IPs by using the web console

The gateway IP cannot be removed from the reserved IPs, while other reserved IPs can be edited, deleted, or added freely.

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left sidebar, click on **Network Management** > **Subnets**.

3. Click the name of the subnet.

4. Select **Action** > **Update Reserved IP**.

        "matchLabels": {
          "cpaas.io/project": "cong"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]'
```

### Assigning Namespaces by using the web console \{#kube_ovn_assign_namespaces}

  }
]'
```

### Managing Calico Networks

Support for assigning projects and namespaces; for details, please refer to the [project assignment](#kube_ovn_assign_projects) and [namespace assignment](#kube_ovn_assign_namespaces).

### Delete Subnet by using the web console

:::note

- When a subnet is deleted, if there are still container groups using the IPs within the subnet, the container groups can continue to run and the IP addresses will remain unchanged, but they will be unable to communicate over the network. The container groups can be rebuilt to use IPs within the default subnet, or assign a new subnet to the namespace where the container groups reside for usage.

- The default subnet cannot be deleted.
  :::

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network Management** > **Subnets**.

3. Click ⋮ > **Delete**, and proceed with the deletion.
