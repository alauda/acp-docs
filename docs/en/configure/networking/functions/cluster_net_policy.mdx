# Configure Cluster Network Policies

Cluster network policies are responsible for managing **project-level** access control rules. When this feature is enabled, different projects are isolated from each other by default, and compute components in different projects cannot access each other over the network. Communication can be achieved by adding **Access between Projects** or **Access Using IP Addresses** rules.

Once configured, the cluster network policies will be synchronized to the namespaces under the cluster, and can be viewed in the **Network Policies** feature module of the container platform.

## Notes

- The effectiveness of the cluster network policies depends on whether the network plugin used by the cluster supports network policies.

  - Kube-OVN and Calico support network policies.
  - Flannel does not support network policies.
  - When accessing the cluster or using a custom network plugin, you can refer to the relevant documentation to confirm support.

- The functionality is in Alpha maturity under the Kube-OVN network mode.

## Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Network** > **Cluster Network Policies**.

3. Click **Configure Now**.

4. Follow the instructions below to complete the relevant configuration.

   | Configuration Item | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
   | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Isolation between Projects** | Whether to enable the complete isolation switch between projects, which is enabled by default and can be turned off by clicking. When enabled, network isolation is achieved between all projects in the current cluster, and other resources are not allowed to access any project within the cluster (e.g., external IPs, load balancers). This does not affect projects' access to resources outside the cluster. |
   | **Access between Projects**  | This parameter is only effective when the **Isolation between Projects** switch is enabled.<br />Configure the **source project** and **target project** for one-way access.<br />Click **Add** to add a configuration record, supporting multiple records.<br />In the **source project** dropdown, select a project that will access the target project or select all projects; in the **target project** dropdown, select the target project to be accessed. |
   | **Access Using IP Addresses** | This parameter is only effective when the **Isolation between Projects** switch is enabled.<br />Configure the specific **IP/segment** and **target project** for one-way access.<br />Click **Add** to add a configuration record, supporting multiple records.<br />In the **source IP segment** input box, enter the IP or CIDR segment to access the target project; in the **target project** dropdown, select the target project to be accessed. |

5. Click **Configure**.
