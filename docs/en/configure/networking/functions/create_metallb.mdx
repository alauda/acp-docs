# Creating External IP Address Pool

An external IP address pool is a collection of IPs that MetalLB utilizes to obtain external access IPs for LoadBalancer type internal routes.

## Prerequisites

If you need to use a BGP type external IP address pool, please contact the administrator to enable the relevant features.

## Constraints and Limitations

The IP resources for the external address must meet the following conditions:

- The external address pool must be layer 2 (L2) interconnected with available nodes.

- The IPs must be usable by the platform and cannot include IPs already in use by the physical network, such as gateway IPs.

- There must be no overlap with the networks used by the cluster, including Cluster CIDR, Service CIDR, subnets, etc.

- In a dual-stack environment, ensure that both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses exist simultaneously in the same external address pool, and their counts are both greater than 0. Otherwise, dual-stack LoadBalancer type internal routes will not be able to obtain external access addresses.

- In an IPv6 environment, nodes' DNS must support IPv6; otherwise, the MetalLB plugin cannot be successfully deployed.

## Deploying the MetalLB Plugin

Using the external address pool relies on the MetalLB plugin.

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Marketplace** > **Cluster Plugin**.

3. Search MetalLB, click on **MetalLB** to the right of â‹® > **Deploy**.

4. Wait until the deployment status shows **Deployment Successful** to complete the deployment.

## Example IPAddressPool custom resource (CR)

```yaml
# ippool-with-L2advertisement.yaml
kind: IPAddressPool
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: test-ippool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 13.1.1.1/24
  avoidBuggyIPs: true
---
kind: L2Advertisement
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: test-ippool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
    - test-ippool #[!code callout]
  nodeSelectors:
    - matchLabels: {}
      matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
            - 192.168.66.210
```

BGP mode:

```yaml
# ippool-with-bgpadvertisement.yaml
kind: IPAddressPool
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: test-pool-bgp
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 4.4.4.3/23
  avoidBuggyIPs: true
---
kind: BGPAdvertisement
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: test-pool-bgp
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
    - test-pool-bgp
  nodeSelectors:
    - matchLabels:
        alertmanager: "true"
  peers:
    - test-bgp-example
```

Q: What is `L2Advertisement`?

A:

1. `L2Advertisement` is a Custom Resource (CRD) provided by the MetalLB to control which IP address pool addresses should be broadcast via ARP (IPv4) or NDP (IPv6) in Layer 2 mode.

Q: What is the purpose of `L2Advertisement`?

A:

1. Specifying which IP addresses in the IPAddressPool to L2 broadcast to (ARP/NDP advertisements);

2. Control broadcast behaviour to prevent IP conflicts or cross-segment broadcasts;

3. Restricting the broadcast range in multi-NIC, multi-network environments.

In short, it tells MetalLB: which IPs can broadcast and to whom (e.g., which nodes).

Without defining a `L2Advertisement` in Layer2 mode, MetalLB will not advertise any addresses.

Q: What is `BGPAdvertisement` in MetalLB?

A:

`BGPAdvertisement` is a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) used in [MetalLB](https://metallb.io/), a load-balancer implementation for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters. It controls how IP address ranges (defined in `IPAddressPool`) are advertised to external networks via BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

Q: Why is `BGPAdvertisement` Important?

A:

In MetalLB's BGP mode, the controller peers with external routers using BGP and advertises the IPs assigned to Kubernetes `Service` objects. The `BGPAdvertisement` resource allows you to:

- Control which address pools are advertised

- Customize route advertisement settings like:

  - Route aggregation

  - BGP communities

  - Local preference (BGP priority)

Without defining a `BGPAdvertisement`, MetalLB will not advertise any addresses, even if you have configured BGP peers.
