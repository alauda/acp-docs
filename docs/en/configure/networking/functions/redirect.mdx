# HTTP Redirect

## Basic Concept

HTTP redirect is a feature provided by ALB. It will directly return a 30x HTTP code for the request that matches the rule. The Location header will be used to instruct the client to redirect to the new URL.

ALB supports redirect configuration at the port and rule levels.

## CRD

```yaml
redirect:
  properties:
    code:
      type: integer
    host:
      type: string
    port:
      type: integer
    prefix_match:
      type: string
    replace_prefix:
      type: string
    scheme:
      type: string
    url:
      type: string
  type: object
```

Redirect could be configured on:

- Frontend: `.spec.config.redirect`
- Rule: `.spec.config.redirect`

## Ingress Annotation

| Annotation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect | Corresponds to URL in CR, will set code to 301 by default |
| nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect-code | Corresponds to code in CR |
| nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/temporal-redirect | Corresponds to URL in CR, will set code to 302 by default |
| nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/temporal-redirect-code | Corresponds to code in CR |
| nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect | Corresponds to scheme in CR, will set scheme to HTTPS by default |
| nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect | Corresponds to scheme in CR, will set scheme to HTTPS by default |

### SSL-Redirect

1. SSL-redirect and force-ssl-redirect differ in that SSL-redirect only takes effect when the ingress has a certificate for the corresponding domain, while force-ssl-redirect takes effect regardless of whether there is a certificate.
2. For HTTPS ports, if only SSL-redirect is configured, the redirect will not be set.

## Port Level Redirect

When redirect is configured at the port level, *all requests* to this port will be redirected according to the redirect configuration.

## Rule Level Redirect

When redirect is configured at the rule level, the request matching this rule will be redirected according to the redirect configuration.
