# Creating Admin Network Policies

:::info
The platform now provides two different UIs for Cluster Network Policies. The old one is maintained for compatibility reasons, while the new one is more flexible and provides a native YAML editor. We recommend using the new version.

Please contact the platform administrator to enable the `cluster-network-policy` and `cluster-network-policy-next` feature-gate to access the new UI.
:::

The new cluster network policy adopts the Kubernetes community's [Admin Network Policy](https://network-policy-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-overview/) standard design, providing more flexible configuration methods and rich configuration options.

When multiple network policies are applied, they follow a strict priority order: Admin Network Policy takes precedence over Network Policy, which in turn takes precedence over Baseline Admin Network Policy.

The procedure is as followsï¼š

## Notes

- Only Kube-OVN CNI supports admin network policies.

- In Kube-OVN network mode, this feature is at Alpha maturity level.

- Only one Baseline Admin Network Policy can exist in the cluster.

AdminNetworkPolicy

```yaml
# example-anp.yaml
apiVersion: policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: AdminNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: example-anp
spec:
  priority: 3 #[!code callout]
  subject: #[!code callout]
    pods:
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels: {}
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          pod-template-hash: 55f66dd67d
  ingress:
    - name: ingress1
      action: Allow #[!code callout]
      ports:
        - portNumber:
            protocol: TCP
            port: 8090
      from: #[!code callout]
        - pods:
            namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels: {}
            podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                pod-template-hash: 55c84b59bb
  egress:
    - name: egress1
      action: Allow
      ports:
        - portNumber:
            protocol: TCP
            port: 8080
      to: #[!code callout]
        - networks:
            - 10.1.1.1/23
```

<Callouts>

1. The lower the number, the higher the priority.
2. `subject`: At most one of namespace selector or pod selector can be specified.
3. `action`: The available values are Allow, Deny, and Pass.
   Allow for allowing traffic access, Deny for denying traffic access, Pass for allowing the traffic and skip subsequent low priority cluster network policies and continue to have the traffic handled by other policies (NetworkPolicy and BaselineAdminNetworkpolicy).
4. The available values are Namespace Selector, Pod Selector.
5. The available values are Namespace Selector, Pod Selector, Node Selector, IP Block.

</Callouts>

BaselineAdminNetworkpolicy:

```yaml
# default.yaml
apiVersion: policy.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default # [!code callout]
spec:
  subject:
    pods:
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels: {}
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          pod-template-hash: 55c84b59bb
  ingress:
    - name: ingress1
      action: Allow
      ports:
        - portNumber:
            protocol: TCP
            port: 8888
      from:
        - pods:
            namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels: {}
            podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                pod-template-hash: 55f66dd67d
  egress:
    - name: egress1
      action: Allow # [!code callout]
      ports:
        - portNumber:
            protocol: TCP
            port: 8080
      to:
        - networks:
            - 3.3.3.3/23
```

<Callouts>

1. Only one baseline admin network policy with metadata.name=`default` can be created in the cluster.
2. The available values are Allow, Deny.

</Callouts>

## Creating AdminNetworkPolicy or BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy by using the web console

1.  Go to **Administrator**.

2.  In the left navigation bar, click **Network** > **Cluster Network Policies**.

3.  Click **Create Admin Network Policies** or **Configure the Baseline Admin Network Policy**.

4.  Follow the instructions below to complete the relevant configuration.
