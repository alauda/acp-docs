:::info
The platform now provides two different UIs for Cluster Network Policies. The old one is maintained for compatibility reasons, while the new one is more flexible and provides a native YAML editor. We recommend using the new version.

Please contact the platform administrator to enable the **cluster-network-policy** and **cluster-network-policy-next** feature-gate to access the new UI.

# Configure Admin Network Policies

The new cluster network policy adopts the Kubernetes community's Admin Network Policy standard design, providing more flexible configuration methods and rich configuration options.

When multiple network policies are applied, they follow a strict priority order: Admin Network Policy takes precedence over Network Policy, which in turn takes precedence over Baseline Admin Network Policy.

## Notes

- Only KUBE-OVN CNI supports admin network policies.

- In Kube-OVN network mode, this feature is at Alpha maturity level.

- Only one Baseline Admin Network Policy can exist in the cluster.

## Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network** > **Cluster Network Policies**.

3. Click **Create Admin Network Policies** or **Configure the Baseline Admin Network Policy**.

4. Follow the instructions below to complete the relevant configuration.
