# How to properly allocate CPU and memory resources

For the platform's proposed specifications for **small**, **medium**, **large**, and **custom** production environments, as well as the resource allocation methods for **instances** and **ports**, the following suggestions can be referenced for deployment.

## Small Production Environment

For smaller business scales, such as having no more than 5 nodes in the cluster and only used for running standard applications, a **single** load balancer is sufficient. It is recommended to use it in a **high availability** mode with at least 2 replicas to ensure stability in the environment.

You can isolate the load balancer using **port** isolation, allowing multiple projects to share it.

The peak QPS measured in a lab environment for this specification is approximately 300 requests per second.

## Medium Production Environment

When the business volume reaches a certain scale, such as having no more than 30 nodes in the cluster and needing to handle high-concurrency business alongside running standard applications, a **single** load balancer will still be adequate. It is advisable to employ a **high availability** mode with at least 3 replicas to maintain stability in the environment.

You can utilize either **port** isolation or **instance** allocation methods to share the load balancer among multiple projects. Of course, you can also create new load balancers for dedicated use by core projects.

The peak QPS measured in a lab environment for this specification is around 10,000 requests per second.

## Large Production Environment

For larger business volumes, such as having more than 30 nodes in the cluster and needing to handle high-concurrency business as well as long-lived data connections, it is recommended to use **multiple** load balancers, each in a **high availability** type with at least 3 replicas to ensure stability in the environment.

You can isolate the load balancer using either **port** isolation or **instance** allocation methods for multiple projects to share it. You may also create new load balancers for exclusive use by core projects.

The peak QPS measured in a lab environment for this specification is approximately 20,000 requests per second.

## Special Scenario Deployment Recommendations

| Scenario                          | Deployment Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Function Testing**              | It is advisable to deploy a **single instance** of the load balancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Testing Environment**           | If the testing environment meets the definitions of **small** or **medium** as stated above, using a **single point** load balancer is sufficient. The load balancer **instance** can be shared among **multiple projects**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Core Applications**             | It is recommended to use specific load balancers exclusively for core applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Transferring Large Scale Data** | Due to minimal memory consumption caused by the load balancer itself, it is sufficient to reserve 2Gi of memory even for the **large** specification. However, if the business requires transferring large-scale data, which will lead to substantial memory consumption, the memory allocation for the load balancer should be increased accordingly. <br /><br /> It is recommended to gradually expand the memory of the load balancer in **custom** specification scenarios, closely monitoring memory usage to ultimately arrive at an acceptable memory size for reasonable usage rates. |
