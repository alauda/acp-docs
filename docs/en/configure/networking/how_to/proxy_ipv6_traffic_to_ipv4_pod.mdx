# Forwarding IPv6 Traffic to IPv4 Addresses within the Cluster

By configuring an external load balancer for the cluster, we can forward IPv6 traffic to the internal IPv4 addresses within the cluster. This allows us to introduce IPv6 capabilities over the existing IPv4 network, providing greater flexibility and scalability to our system architecture, and better addressing diverse network demands.

### Configuration Method

1. Configure the IPv6 address for the node where the load balancer is located.

2. Ensure that the external load balancer has an IPv6 address, and make sure that traffic accessing the load balancer's IPv6 address can be forwarded to the IPv6 address of the node where the load balancer resides.

Once the above configuration is completed, the IPv4 services mounted on the load balancer can provide external IPv6 access capabilities through the load balancer.

### Result Verification

After the configuration, accessing the IPv6 address of the external load balancer should allow normal access to the application.
