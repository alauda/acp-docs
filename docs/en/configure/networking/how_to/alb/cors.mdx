# CORS

## Basic Concepts
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.

## CRD
```yaml
enableCORS:
  description: enableCORS is the switch whether enable cross domain,
    when EnableCORS is false, alb2 transports information to backend
    servers which determine whether allow cross-domain
  type: boolean
corsAllowHeaders:
  description: corsAllowHeaders defines the headers allowed by cors
    when enableCORS is true, multiple headers are separated by commas
  type: string
corsAllowOrigin:
  description: corsAllowOrigin defines the origin allowed by cors when
    enableCORS is true, multiple origins are separated by commas
  type: string
```

It can be configured on the rule `.spec`.
