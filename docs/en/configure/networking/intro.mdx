# Introduction

The container network is a comprehensive networking solution designed for cloud-native applications, ensuring seamless east-west communication within clusters and efficient north-south traffic management across external networks,
while providing essential networking functionalities. It consists of these core components:

- Container Network Interfaces (CNIs) for east-west traffic management within the cluster.
- Ingress Gateway Controller ALB for managing HTTPS ingress traffic.
- MetalLB for handling LoadBalancer type Services.
- Additionally, it provides robust network security and encryption features to ensure secure communication.

## Usage Limitations

While the container network provides extensive functionalities, the following limitations should be noted:

- **Underlay Network Requirement**

  Some underlay network capabilities, such as Kube-OVN Underlay Subnet, Egress IP, and MetalLB, require underlying L2 network support.
  These features cannot be used in public cloud providers and certain virtualized environments like AWS and GCP.

With its versatile design and comprehensive feature set, the container network empowers organizations to build, scale, and manage secure, reliable, and high-performance containerized applications.
