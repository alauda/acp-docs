- **ALB Operator**: An operator that manage the lifecycle of ALB instances. It is responsible for watching ALB CRs and then creating and updating ALB instances for different tenants. 
- **ALB Instance**: The ALB instance includes an Openresty that act as the data plan and a Go controller as the controller plan. 
The Go controller monitors various CRs (Ingress, Gateway, Rule, etc.) and converts them into ALB-specific DSL rules. OpenResty then uses these DSL rules to match and process incoming requests.
