title: "ETCD Backup"

The etcd component on the cluster is a distributed data storage component responsible for storing cluster configuration information. etcd is deployed on all control plane nodes of the cluster.

After deploying the Alauda Container Platform Cluster Enhancer plugin, an EtcdBackupConfiguration resource is automatically created for the cluster configuration. The EtcdBackupConfiguration contains information about backup data sources (control nodes, backup paths), backup data storage locations, backup methods, and more. Each backup execution based on the policy generates a new backup record, enabling you to backup cluster configurations on-demand or automatically on a periodic basis.

## Limitations

In some extreme cases, if your cluster has three control nodes, you may encounter the situation where all three control nodes are down at the same time. In this case, to ensure that you can fully recover the cluster, it is recommended to refer to the S2 plan in the Customer Portal, which provides recovery guidance for such extreme cases.

## Prerequisites

1. Alauda Container Platform Cluster Enhancer is [installed](../install.mdx) in the current cluster.

## Viewing Backup Records

To view etcd backup records:

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Operation Center** > **Monitor** > **Dashboards**.

2. Click **Switch** in the upper right corner of the page.

3. Click **Cluster** â†’ **etcd backup** to check the etcd backup records.

## Configuration Management

If you need to modify the default etcd backup configuration, refer to the S2 plan in the Customer Portal for detailed configuration options.
