title: "ETCD Backup"

The etcd service on the cluster is a distributed key-value store responsible for storing cluster configuration information. etcd is deployed on all control plane nodes of the cluster.

After deploying the Alauda Container Platform Cluster Enhancer plugin, an EtcdBackupConfiguration resource is automatically created for the cluster configuration. The EtcdBackupConfiguration contains information about backup data sources (control nodes, backup paths), backup data storage locations, backup methods, and more. Each backup execution based on the policy generates a new backup record, enabling you to back up cluster configurations on-demand or automatically on a periodic basis.

## Limitations

In some extreme cases, if your cluster has three control plane nodes, you may encounter the situation where all three control plane nodes are down at the same time. If you encounter this situation, contact technical support to ensure full recovery of the cluster.

## Prerequisites

1. Alauda Container Platform Cluster Enhancer is [installed](../install.mdx) in the current cluster.

## Viewing Backup Records

To view etcd backup records:

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Operation Center** > **Monitor** > **Dashboards**.

2. Click **Switch** in the upper right corner of the page.

3. Click **Cluster** â†’ **etcd backup** to view the etcd backup records.

## Configuration Management

To modify the default etcd backup configuration, contact technical support for detailed configuration options and advanced settings.
