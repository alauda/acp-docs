# Create Application Backup

Create an application backup schedule to define the scope of data to back up (by namespace), the backup storage location, method, and related parameters. Each run based on the schedule generates a new backup record, enabling automatic backups for application resources in selected namespaces on demand or at a defined frequency.

## Prerequisites

- The backup components are installed. For installation instructions, see [application installation](../overview.mdx#application-installation).
- The backup repository is [configured](./repository.mdx).

## Procedure

:::warning
* To back up application data, include PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). PVCs bound to `hostPath` PersistentVolumes are not supported.
* To ensure reliability and data integrity, do not back up database data (for example, MySQL-PXC, Redis). Use Data Services for database backups.
* Avoid reads, writes, updates, and deletes in the namespaces being backed up to prevent drift and inconsistencies after migration.
:::
<Steps>
### Basic information

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Clusters** > **Backup and Recovery**.

2. Switch to the **Backup Management** tab.

3. Click **Create Backup Policy** > **Create Application Backup** and configure the parameters as follows.

    * **Backup Resource Type**: **Kubernetes Resources** includes all Kubernetes resource files in the selected namespaces. **PVCs** are persistent volume claims used to back up application data bound to persistent volumes. PVCs bound to `hostPath` volumes are not supported.

        :::tip

        * If the storage resource used by your PVC has a **Recycle Strategy** of **Retain**, only Kubernetes resources need to be backed up.

        * If the storage resource used by your PVC has a **Recycle Strategy** of **Delete**, both Kubernetes resources and PVCs need to be backed up.
        :::
    * **Backup Repository**: Select a repository that has passed connectivity verification, or click [Create Backup Repository](./repository.mdx).

      :::tip
      After creating a repository, click **OK and Create Application Backup** to return and continue, or click **Create** to return to the repository list to view created repositories.
      :::

4. After configuring the basic information, click **Next**.

### Backup resources

Back up application resources under the selected namespaces.

::::note

* Namespaces that have not been imported in the cluster are not displayed. To back up such namespaces, import them into the project first.

* To ensure reliability and integrity, do not back up database data (for example, MySQL-PXC, Redis). Use Data Services for database backups.
::::
1. Select one or more **Namespaces** to be backed up.

    :::tip
    When selecting **Backup Kubernetes resources and Persistent Volume Claims**, the Persistent Volume Claims column lists all PVCs in the namespace.
    :::

2. **(Optional)** Configure resource filtering options to refine the backup scope:

    * **Included Namespace Resources**: Select specific namespace-scoped resource types to include in the backup. Only the selected resource types within the chosen namespaces will be backed up. This field supports fuzzy search and multi-selection.

    * **Included Cluster Resources**: Select specific cluster-scoped resource types to include in the backup. Only explicitly selected cluster-scoped resources will be backed up. By default, no cluster-scoped resources are backed up unless included. This field supports fuzzy search and multi-selection.

    * **Excluded Namespace Resources**: Select namespace-scoped resource types to exclude from the backup. Velero will not back up the selected resource types. This field supports fuzzy search and multi-selection.

    * **Label Selectors**: Add label selectors to filter resources. Only resources matching the configured expressions will be backed up. Multiple selectors are combined with OR logic. Each selector supports two matching methods:

        **matchLabels** - Simple key-value matching:

        | Parameter | Type | Description |
        |-----------|------|-------------|
        | Key | string (required) | Label key |
        | Value | string (optional) | Label value |

        **matchExpressions** - Complex conditional matching:

        | Parameter | Type | Description |
        |-----------|------|-------------|
        | Key | string (required) | Label key |
        | Operator | string (required) | One of `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist` |
        | Values | array (conditional) | Array of values. Required for `In`/`NotIn`, must be empty for `Exists`/`DoesNotExist` |

        :::note
        If a matched resource has mounted PVCs and the backup mode includes PVC data (based on `defaultVolumesToFsBackup`), the mounted PVC data will also be backed up unless excluded by Pod annotations (for example, `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes-excludes`).
        :::

3. Click **Next**.

### Method

Configure the backup schedule.

* **Backup once only**: Executes immediately after creation. After setting the **Backup retention period**, backups exceeding the retention period are cleaned up automatically.

* **Scheduled**: Set a **Backup rule** to execute the policy periodically. A crontab expression is supported.

    :::tip

    * Use the platform's preset **Backup rule templates**, then adjust as needed.

    * Recommended minimum frequencies: once per day for **Backup Kubernetes resources and Persistent Volume Claims**; once per hour for **Backup Kubernetes resources**.
    :::
### Advanced configuration

If required, [configure custom hooks](./hooks.mdx) to run during the backup process.


</Steps>

## Relevant operations

### Run the backup schedule manually

Manually execute a created schedule (including those with periodic rules). Each execution generates a new backup record.

1. On the left navigation bar, click **Clusters** > **Backup and Recovery**.

2. Switch to the **Backup Management** tab.

3. Click **Execute Backup** on the right of the schedule, then confirm.

### Export backup task logs

Manually export the backup task log for a specified schedule.

:::tip
Log export is not supported while the backup task is in progress.
:::

**Procedure**

1. On the left navigation bar, click **Clusters** > **Backup and Recovery**.

2. Switch to the **Backup Management** tab.

3. Click the **Backup Schedule Name** to view the backup record, then in the **Backup Records** area click **Export Log** on the right of the record.
