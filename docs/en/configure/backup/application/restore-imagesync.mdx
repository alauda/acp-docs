# Image Registry Replacement

For cross-cluster and cross-platform recovery scenarios, use this procedure to restore application images so they can pull from the correct repository after migration.

* **Image repository migration**: When the image repository changes, update application image references to the new repository.
* **Image synchronization**: When synchronizing images to other projects within the repository (for example, promoting from test to production), update application image references to the new version.

## Procedure

1. Before performing the recovery task, create a ConfigMap that maps old to new image repositories. Replace the placeholders in the following example and save as `change-registry-config.yaml`.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: change-registry-config
      namespace: cpaas-system
      labels:
        velero.io/plugin-config: ""
        alauda.io/change-registry: RestoreItemAction
    data:
      old: <Old Image Repository Address>
      new: <New Image Repository Address>
    ```

    
2. On a control-plane node of the target cluster, create the ConfigMap:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f change-registry-config.yaml
    ```


3. After creation, continue with the [application recovery task](./restore-app.mdx).
