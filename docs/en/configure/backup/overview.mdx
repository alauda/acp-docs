# Overview

Alauda Container Platform provides two types of backup and restore operations:

- **Cluster backup and restore**: Backs up and restores control plane data, including etcd, registry, logging, and monitoring data.
- **Application backup and restore**: Backs up and restores applications and their persistent volumes based on Velero.

## Cluster backup and restore

Cluster backup protects the control plane state and platform data.

### etcd backup and restore

etcd is the key-value store for Alauda Container Platform, which persists the state of all resource objects. An etcd backup plays a crucial role in disaster recovery.

**How it works**:
- etcd backup is provided by **Alauda Container Platform Cluster Enhancer**
- Supports both local storage and S3-compatible object storage
- For clusters running on Immutable OS, S3 storage is **required** (local storage is not supported)

**Restore**: Contact technical support for etcd restore operations.

### etcd installation

To enable etcd backup:

1. Download **Alauda Container Platform Cluster Enhancer** from the <Term name="company" /> Customer Portal.
2. [Upload the package](/extend/upload_package.mdx) to the platform.
3. [Install the plugin](/extend/cluster_plugin.mdx) on your cluster.

After installation, an EtcdBackupConfiguration resource is automatically created.

### Registry backup and restore

[Todo: Link to registry backup documentation]

### Logging backup and restore

Currently supports ClickHouse. Contact technical support.

### Monitoring backup and restore

For monitoring backup and restore, see [VictoriaMetrics Backup and Recovery](/observability/monitor/how_to/restore_victoriametrics.mdx).

## Application backup and restore

As a cluster administrator, you can back up and restore applications running on Alauda Container Platform by using Velero.

### Architecture

Application backup and restore consists of two components:

- **Alauda Container Platform Data Backup Essentials**: Provides the UI and is installed on the global cluster.
- **Alauda Container Platform Data Backup for Velero**: Provides Velero and is installed on workload clusters.

### application installation

To enable application backup and restore:

1. Download **Alauda Container Platform Data Backup Essentials** and **Alauda Container Platform Data Backup for Velero** from the <Term name="company" /> Customer Portal.
2. [Upload the packages](/extend/upload_package.mdx) to the platform.
3. [Install Data Backup Essentials](/extend/cluster_plugin.mdx) on the global cluster.
4. [Install Data Backup for Velero](/extend/cluster_plugin.mdx) on workload clusters.

After installation, configure a [backup repository](./application/repository.mdx) to store backup data.

### Backing up and restoring applications

You back up applications by creating backup schedules and restore applications by executing recovery tasks.

For detailed instructions, see:
- [Create application backups](./application/backup-app.mdx)
- [Restore applications](./application/restore-app.mdx)

## Backup considerations

Before configuring backup policies, consider the following architectural factors that affect backup and recovery strategies.

### Immutable OS clusters

For clusters running on Immutable OS, **VM Snapshot is not required or recommended** as a backup strategy for disaster recovery scenarios.

**Why VM Snapshot is not recommended**:

- **Immutable OS design**: The operating system layer is read-only and managed centrally by the platform. When a node fails, the platform automatically creates a new node with the correct configuration.
- **Distributed system nature**: Kubernetes is a distributed system. VM Snapshot cannot capture the consistent state of distributed components like etcd quorum.
- **Disaster recovery limitations**: VM Snapshot is typically stored with original data and cannot handle site-level disasters.

**Recommended backup approach**:

- **Cluster state**: Use etcd backups to capture control plane state
- **Application data**: Use PV snapshots or Restic for persistent volumes
- **Cluster configuration**: Use GitOps/IaC for configuration management

## Usage scenarios

### Backup and restore within the current cluster

Restore applications to the current cluster after accidental deletion or failure. Application resources typically do not require modification during recovery.

### Cross-cluster application migration

Common scenarios include:

- Development and testing across data centers
- Resource migration between clusters
- Replication from production to development/testing clusters

**Considerations**:

- Ensure similar CPU and memory specifications between source and target clusters
- Maintain consistent network modes to avoid resource restoration issues
- If subnets differ, pod IPs will change after recovery
- Assess whether image migration is required before restoring data
