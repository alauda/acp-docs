1. What is an introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or functional modules, providing an overview of the product or function. It covers core concepts, major features, target users, and intended uses, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

We typically decide whether to include the sections on introduction, advantages, and feature overview in the same document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that contain multiple core modules), it is recommended to break these contents into separate documents; for single functional modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. The importance of introduction

There are many aspects involved in a product or functional module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified understanding: Serve as a starting point to provide a consistent understanding and reduce communication errors.
- Guide reading: Offer clear product background to facilitate deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Improve efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repeated explanations of foundational product knowledge.

3. How to conceive the introduction section

- Concise and clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language and avoid verbosity.
- Highlight key points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main features of the product.
- Audience-oriented: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information that matters to them.

4. The uniqueness of the introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for functional module descriptions in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the value of product functionalities, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize the product features.

We will find some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of product-level introductions

- **Product positioning**: Clearly state the productâ€™s position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive, needing joint explanations based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of module-level introductions

- **Module positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the individual module.
- **Applicable scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Aside from this introduction section, if other chapters are too lengthy or relatively complex, they can be made independent.

This section provides a brief description of what \<Product/Module Name> is intended for. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module aimed at cloud-native applications, built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure to achieve unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the application cloud migration process for enterprises, and effectively reducing operation and maintenance management and labor costs. With Container Management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly set up an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
