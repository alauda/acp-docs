# About Machine Configuration

**Machine Configuration** provides centralized management of the underlying operating system, allowing the platform to define and distribute OS configurations (such as kernel parameters, system services, and network settings) in a declarative manner. This ensures consistent configuration and runtime environments across all nodes, reducing operational complexity.

Note that **Machine Configuration is only supported in Immutable Infrastructure**. In this architecture, the node operating system is immutable, and configuration updates are applied through controlled images or configuration policies, ensuring repeatability and system stability.

:::info
Because Machine Configuration releases on a different cadence from <Term name="product" />, the Machine Configuration documentation is now available as a separate documentation set at <ExternalSiteLink name="immutable-infra" href="/machine_config/index.html" children="Machine Configuration" />.
