# Updating Public Repository Credentials

## Overview

The `Public Repository` is a platform-provided image registry service available on the public internet. When you want your clusters to use the `Public Repository` as their image registry, you need to update the built-in `public-registry-credential` Cloud Credentials. This ensures your platform has permission to pull images from the public registry.

## Procedure

1. Log in to the **Customer Portal** and download your organization's authentication file from the **Enterprise Management** section located in the **User Information** dropdown in the upper right corner.

2. Navigate to **Clusters** > **Cloud Credential** in the left navigation bar of the **Administrator** console.

3. Locate the cloud credential named `public-registry-credential` and click **Update** from the dropdown menu on the right.

4. In the **Upload Public Repository Address** section, upload the authentication file you downloaded from the **Customer Portal**.

5. Click **Update** to apply the changes.
