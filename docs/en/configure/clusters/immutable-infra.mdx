# About Immutable Infrastructure

Immutable Infrastructure uses an immutable operating system to provision Kubernetes clusters. Unlike traditional OS-based clusters, all node configurations are baked into images and remain unchanged after deployment. Cluster upgrades and configuration changes are applied by replacing nodes with new images, ensuring consistency, reliability, and simplified operations throughout the cluster lifecycle.
