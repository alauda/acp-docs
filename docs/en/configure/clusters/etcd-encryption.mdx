# etcd Encryption

This guide helps you install, understand, and operate the etcd Encryption Manager in <Term name="productShort" textCase="upper" /> to automate etcd data encryption key rotation within your clusters.

It ensures that sensitive data stored in etcd, such as secrets and configmaps, is encrypted using a secure algorithm, enhancing your cluster's security.

## Installation

See [Cluster Plugin](/extend/cluster_plugin.mdx) for installation instructions.

## How it Works

Upon installation, an `etcd-encryption-manager` controller is deployed in the `kube-system` namespace, which:

* Periodically rotates etcd data encryption keys.
* Retains the 8 most recent keys for rollback compatibility.
* Updates encryption configurations on all control nodes.
* Triggers `kube-apiserver` to hot reload new keys.
* Automatically migrates resources to re-encrypt data with new keys.

Cluster stability is maintained throughout these operations.

### Default Configuration

| Parameter            | Value               |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Encrypted resources  | secrets, configmaps |
| Encryption algorithm | 256-bit AES-GCM     |
| Rotation interval    | 168 hours (7 days)  |

### Configuration Files

| Path                                              | Content                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/kubernetes/encryption-provider.conf`        | Current encryption configuration          |
| `/etc/kubernetes/encryption-provider-history.bak` | Historical key records (for recovery)     |
| `/etc/kubernetes/encryption-provider-bak/`        | Expired encryption configuration versions |

### Checking Status

Run the following command to check the current rotation status:

```bash
kubectl get EtcdEncryptionConfig default -o yaml
```

Example output:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.alauda.io/v1alpha1
kind: EtcdEncryptionConfig
metadata:
  name: default

    - secrets
    - configmaps
