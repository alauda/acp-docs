# Add Nodes to On-Premises Clusters

When a cluster needs to scale up or when abnormal nodes on the cluster need to be replaced with new nodes, you can add control plane nodes and compute nodes to existing **on-premises** workload clusters on the platform by adding nodes.

## Constraints and Limitations

* Nodes to be added to the cluster must be prepared in advance. Please refer to the [Node Availability Check Reference](/install/prepare/node_preprocessing.mdx#node_checks) to prepare and check nodes to be added to the cluster. Ensure all conditions are met, otherwise cluster deployment may fail.

* The hardware architecture of nodes to be added must be consistent with the cluster's hardware architecture.

* To avoid unpredictable errors, the operating system type of nodes to be added should be consistent with other nodes in the cluster.

* SSH ports and authentication information for nodes added in the same **Add Node** dialog must be unified.

* **Cluster planning guideline**: A cluster must have at least 1 control plane node. Setting exactly 2 control plane nodes is not supported. With 3 or more control plane nodes, the cluster becomes a high-availability cluster (for high-availability clusters, it is recommended to use an odd number of nodes, preferably 3 or 5). **Note**: This requirement applies only when adding or changing control plane capacity; you can safely add worker/compute nodes without being forced to add control plane nodes.

* A node can only belong to one cluster. Nodes to be added cannot be occupied by other clusters.

## Prerequisites

* When the global cluster cannot directly access nodes to be added to the cluster through SSH service and needs to access through a proxy, prepare the proxy service in advance. Currently, only SOCKS5 proxy is supported.

## Procedure

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Clusters** > **Clusters**.

2. Click the ***cluster name*** of type **On-Premises** where you want to add nodes.

3. Under the **Nodes** tab, click **Add Node**.

4. Refer to [Node Configuration Parameters](/configure/clusters/on-premises.mdx#node-settings) to configure relevant parameters.

5. Click **Add** to perform availability check on the nodes.<br/>After the check passes, node addition begins, and the nodes are in **Adding** state.

## Follow-up Operations    

### View Execution Progress
    
On the node list page, you can view the list information of added nodes. For nodes in **Adding** state, you can view the execution progress.

**Procedure**

1. Click **View Execution Progress** on the right side of nodes in **Adding** state.

2. In the pop-up execution progress dialog, you can view the node execution progress (`status.conditions`).

    **Tip**: When a certain type is executing or has a failed state with a reason, you can view detailed information about the reason (`status.conditions.reason`) by hovering the cursor over the corresponding reason (displayed in blue text).
    
    
### Re-add Failed Nodes

After adding nodes, if some nodes fail to be added, a prompt will appear above the node list. Click the **Re-add** button in the prompt box to re-add the failed nodes.
