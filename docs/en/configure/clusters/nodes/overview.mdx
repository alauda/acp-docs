# Overview

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a cluster. Nodes added to a cluster can be either virtual machines or physical servers. Each node contains the essential components required to run Pods, including Kubelet, Kube-proxy, and Container Runtime.

Users with platform management permissions can manage nodes under clusters.

**Note**: Adding nodes to imported clusters or deleting nodes from imported clusters is not supported.

## Node Types

* **Control Plane Nodes**: Responsible for running cluster components such as kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, etcd, container networking, and some platform management components.

    * When applications are allowed to be deployed on control plane nodes, control plane nodes can also function as compute nodes.

    * At least 1 control plane node must be added. Setting 2 control plane nodes is not supported. With 3 or more control plane nodes, the cluster becomes a high-availability cluster (for high-availability clusters, it is recommended to use an odd number of nodes, preferably 3 or 5).

    * When the number of control plane nodes is 3 or more, the cluster has multi-replica disaster recovery capabilities and is considered a high-availability cluster.

* **Compute Nodes**: Responsible for hosting business Pods running on the cluster. The number of compute nodes required in a cluster can typically be planned based on business volume.

## Linux Node Availability Check \{#node_checks}

If you need to build a on-premises cluster, please first refer to the [cluster check](/install/prepare/node_preprocessing.mdx#node_checks) to ensure all node configurations meet the requirements. All prerequisites must be satisfied, otherwise cluster deployment may fail.

## Supported Operating Systems and CPU Models \{#arch}
Please refer to [Supported Operating Systems and CPU Models](/install/prepare/prerequisites.mdx#supported_os_and_kernels).
