# **Clusters Overview**

The platform provides unified lifecycle management for multiple Kubernetes clusters across different environments. It supports both platform-provisioned clusters and external clusters managed by other cloud providers.

This overview introduces the cluster types, management responsibilities, and supported integration scenarios to help you determine whether your environment is supported and to what extent.

## **Cluster Categories**

According to the Kubernetes lifecycle ownership, clusters managed by the platform are divided into two main categories:

* **Platform-provisioned clusters** – These clusters are created and fully managed by the platform. Kubernetes upgrades, node scaling, and lifecycle operations are handled automatically by the platform.
* **Externally managed clusters** – These clusters are provided and maintained by external cloud providers. The platform connects to these clusters for unified management, but does not manage their infrastructure or Kubernetes lifecycle.

## **Creating Clusters**

The platform supports multiple creation modes to adapt to different infrastructure and resource management needs.

### **1. Immutable Clusters**

* **Description**: The user provides IaaS resources, and the platform integrates with the IaaS layer to enable fully automated cluster creation and lifecycle management.
* **Node OS**: Managed by the platform using an **Immutable OS**, ensuring consistent, secure, and declarative infrastructure state.
* **Supported IaaS**:

  * Huawei Datacenter Virtualization Solution (DCS)

### **2. Non-Immutable Clusters**

* **Description**: The user provides pre-provisioned virtual machines or bare-metal nodes. The platform installs and configures Kubernetes on these nodes, but does not manage the operating system lifecycle (e.g., OS upgrade or replacement).
* **Use case**: Suitable for environments where nodes are managed manually or by an external automation tool.

### **3. HCP Clusters (Hosted Control Plane)**

* **Description**: For environments with limited compute resources or large physical servers, multiple clusters can share a single control plane node.
* **Use case**: Common in physical infrastructure scenarios without virtualization.
* **Benefit**: Reduced resource consumption for control plane components.

## **Connecting Existing Clusters**

The platform supports connecting existing Kubernetes clusters for centralized management, monitoring, and governance.

### **1. Public Cloud Kubernetes Clusters**

* **Description**: The platform provides dedicated **Providers** for major public clouds, such as *Alauda Container Platform EKS Provider*.
* **Capability**:

  * Store cloud credentials securely within the platform.
  * Create and manage cloud-native Kubernetes clusters (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE) directly through the platform.

### **2. CNCF-Compliant Kubernetes Clusters**

* **Description**: Connect any existing cluster that conforms to CNCF Kubernetes standards.
* **Use case**: Ideal for integrating self-managed Kubernetes or clusters from other vendors.
* **Supported versions**: [List or link to supported Kubernetes versions and API compatibility chart.]

### **3. Tunnel-Based Connections**

* **Description**: When a **Global cluster** cannot directly access a **Workload cluster**, connectivity is established through a **Tunnel Server** (in the global cluster) and **Tunnel Agent** (in the workload cluster).
* **Use case**: Suitable for disconnected or restricted network environments.

## **Choosing the Right Scenario**

| User Scenario                                                                 | Recommended Cluster Type | Managed by Platform | Notes                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| You want the platform to automatically create and manage Kubernetes clusters. | Immutable Cluster        | ✓                   | Requires supported IaaS (e.g., DCS).                |
| You have your own prepared servers or VMs.                                    | Non-Immutable Cluster    | ✓                   | Node OS not managed by the platform.                |
| You want multiple clusters sharing a control plane to save resources.         | HCP Cluster              | ✓                   | Ideal for large physical servers.                   |
| You want to manage public cloud Kubernetes clusters from the platform.        | Public Cloud K8s         | Partial             | Platform creates and manages clusters via provider. |
| You want to connect existing CNCF-compliant clusters.                         | Connected Cluster        | Partial             | Platform integrates but does not manage lifecycle.  |
| Your clusters are in a private or restricted network.                         | Tunnel Connection        | Partial             | Managed through tunnel-based integration.           |
