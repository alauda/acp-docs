# Clusters Overview

The platform supports multiple Kubernetes cluster management models depending on how the underlying infrastructure is provisioned and how the control plane is deployed.

## Platform-Provisioned Infrastructure

**Description:**

In this model, the platform provisions both the machines and the node operating systems.
All nodes use an **Immutable OS**, which ensures a consistent, declarative, and easily recoverable infrastructure state.
This model provides full automation across the entire cluster lifecycle — from provisioning to scaling and upgrades.

**Examples of Immutable OS:**

Common Immutable OS examples include **Fedora CoreOS**, **Flatcar Linux**, and **openSUSE MicroOS**.
Currently, the platform supports **MicroOS** for immutable node management.

**Responsibilities:**

| Component        | Managed by                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Machines / Nodes | Platform                     |
| Node OS          | Platform (Immutable OS only) |
| Kubernetes       | Platform                     |

## User-Provisioned Infrastructure

**Description:**

In this model, the user provides pre-provisioned physical or virtual machines.
The platform installs and manages Kubernetes on these nodes, while node OS management — including provisioning, patching, or replacement — remains under the user’s control.

This model is designed for organizations that already have established procedures or automation tools for managing their infrastructure or operating systems.

**Responsibilities:**

| Component        | Managed by |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Machines / Nodes | User       |
| Node OS          | User       |
| Kubernetes       | Platform   |

## Hosted Control Plane (HCP)

**Description:**

**Hosted Control Plane (HCP)** is a deployment model in which multiple clusters share a single control plane hosted in a dedicated management cluster.
Only the control plane components are shared — the worker nodes are still provisioned following one of the two infrastructure models above (either platform-provisioned or user-provisioned).

**Characteristics:**

* Reduces control plane resource consumption.
* Supports mixed models: worker nodes can be immutable or user-provisioned.
* Ideal for large bare-metal or resource-constrained environments.

## Connected Clusters

The platform also supports connecting and managing existing Kubernetes clusters, whether they are public cloud clusters or CNCF-compliant Kubernetes distributions.

### Public Cloud Kubernetes

* Connects to managed Kubernetes services such as EKS, AKS, and GKE through cloud-specific providers (e.g., *Alauda Container Platform EKS Provider*).
* Cloud credentials can be securely stored in the platform.
* Enables creation and management of public cloud clusters directly from the platform.

### CNCF-Compliant Kubernetes

* Connects any existing Kubernetes cluster conforming to CNCF standards.
* Supports unified visibility, policy control, and monitoring across environments.
* [Refer to the Supported Kubernetes Versions list.](#)

### Tunnel-Based Connectivity

* When the **Global cluster** cannot directly access a **Workload cluster**, a **Tunnel Server** (global side) and **Tunnel Agent** (workload side) establish secure communication.
* Suitable for disconnected or restricted network environments.

## Choosing the Right Model

| Scenario                            | Infra Provisioned By | Node OS Managed By           | Kubernetes Managed By | Automation Level |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Platform-provisioned Infrastructure | Platform             | Platform (Immutable OS only) | Platform              | Full             |
| User-provisioned Infrastructure     | User                 | User                         | Platform              | Partial          |
| Hosted Control Plane (HCP)          | Platform             | Shared nodes (Platform)      | Platform              | Partial          |
| Connected Cluster (Cloud or CNCF)   | External Provider    | External Provider            | Partial / External    | Minimal          |
