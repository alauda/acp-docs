# About Hosted Control Plane

**Hosted Control Plane (HCP)** is a lightweight multi-cluster management model that separates the control plane from worker nodes. Each cluster's control plane is containerized and hosted within a management cluster, reducing resource consumption, accelerating cluster creation and upgrades, and improving scalability for multi-cluster operations.
