# overview

The platform supports managing existing standard Kubernetes clusters, OpenShift, Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), and Huawei Cloud CCE (Cloud Container Engine) clusters.

## What is a managed cluster?

A managed cluster refers to consolidating existing clusters into a centralized platform for unified governance. It allows enterprises to bring various cluster types—including standard Kubernetes clusters and certain public cloud clusters—under a single control plane. Centralized management improves scalability, availability, and maintainability, enabling better utilization of compute resources and a more efficient cloud environment. You can onboard clusters to the platform via **Access a cluster** or **Register a cluster**.

## What's the difference between the two onboarding methods?

They differ only in how onboarding is performed; day‑to‑day operations are consistent.

* **Import a cluster**: The platform first obtains information about the target cluster and then actively sends access instructions to it. Using this information, the platform establishes a stable connection for centralized monitoring and management, helping administrators oversee the environment and ensure efficient, secure resource utilization.

* **Register a cluster**: Deploy a reverse proxy in the target cluster, which initiates a registration request to the platform. The cluster uses the CLI to automatically establish a tunnel and communicate securely with the platform. Because no cluster details need to be disclosed, security is enhanced and the process is simpler and more efficient.
