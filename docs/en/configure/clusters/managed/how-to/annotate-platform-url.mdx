title: "Network Configuration for Import Clusters"

## Scenario Description

Before cluster import, only unidirectional connectivity is ensured, allowing the global cluster to access the imported cluster. After cluster import, to ensure the imported cluster can properly access the global cluster and achieve bidirectional connectivity, additional network configuration is required to ensure normal operation of platform functional components.

## Prerequisites

Please prepare in advance the **domain name**, **IP address** that the domain name points to, and the corresponding **valid certificate** that the imported cluster can access.

**Note**:

* This domain name must not be the same as the **platform access address**.

* Ensure that the domain's port (HTTPS port, which is the same port as the platform access address) can forward traffic to all control nodes of the global cluster.

## Adding Annotation Information for Imported Clusters

Specifically, to ensure that alerting and log collection components can properly access the platform, you must add annotation information to the imported cluster.

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Cluster Management** > **Clusters**.

2. Click **global**.

3. Click **Operations** > **CLI Tools**, and replace the relevant parameters using the following command:

    ```shell
    kubectl annotate --overwrite -n cpaas-system clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io <imported cluster name> \
            cpaas.io/platform-url=<prepared domain address, e.g.: https://www.domain.cn>
    ```

    Code example:

    ```shell
    kubectl annotate --overwrite -n cpaas-system clusters.cluster.x-k8s.io cluster-imported \
            cpaas.io/platform-url=https://www.domain.cn
    ```
