Platform integration with Huawei Cloud CCE and storage initialization configuration.

## Constraints and Limitations

Cluster PVC quantity has limits, and account storage capacity has quotas. You can request increases through support tickets.

## Prerequisites

* If you have created a CCE cluster, [import the CCE cluster (Public Cloud)](../managed/import/huawei-cce.mdx); if not, [create a Huawei Cloud CCE cluster](../managed/create/huawei-cce.mdx).

## Configuration Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management** and click **Storage Management** > **Storage Classes** in the left navigation.

2. Click the three dots next to the storage class named **csi-nas** or **csi-disk** > **Update Project**.

    **Note**: After importing a CCE cluster, default storage classes are generated. **csi-disk** is recommended for block storage, and **csi-nas** for file storage. See [Default Storage Class Description](#default-storage-class-description).

3. Select the **Project Assignment** method as needed and click **Update** to assign **csi-nas** or **csi-disk** storage classes to projects.

## Default Storage Class Description

| Storage Class Name | Storage Class Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **(Recommended) csi-disk** | Block Storage | Recommended for use. |
| **(Recommended) csi-nas** | File Storage | Recommended for use. Only available in regions that support csi-nas service. |
| csi-disk-topology | Block Storage | Automatic cloud disk topology when nodes span AZs. |
| csi-local | Local Storage | |
| csi-local-topology | Local Storage | |
| csi-obs | Object Storage | |
| csi-sfsturbo | Ultra-fast File Storage | Ultra-fast file storage cannot dynamically create persistent volumes. |

## Common Issues

### PVC Creation Failure

The following error occurs because the PVC quantity limit has been reached. You can request an increase through support tickets:

```
message: "ShareLimitExceeded: Maximum number of shares allowed (10) exceeded."
```

### Account Overdue

PVC creation fails with the following error due to overdue payments. Please pay promptly:

```
message: "Your account is suspended and resources cannot be used"
```
