Platform integration with Azure AKS and storage initialization configuration.

## Constraints and Limitations

The default azurefile file storage class may not support permission modifications after mounting, which may cause some applications like PostgreSQL and Jenkins to fail to run properly.

## Prerequisites

* If you have created an AKS cluster, [import the Azure AKS cluster](../managed/import/azure-aks.mdx); if not, [create an Azure AKS cluster](../managed/create/azure-aks.mdx).

## Configuration Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management** and click **Storage Management** > **Storage Classes** in the left navigation.

2. Click the three dots next to the storage class named **default** or **azurefile** > **Update Project**.

    **Note**: After importing an AKS cluster, the following default storage classes are generated. **default** is recommended for block storage, and **azurefile** for file storage. See [Default Storage Class Description](#default-storage-class-description).

3. Select the **Project Assignment** method as needed and click **Update** to assign **default** or **azurefile** storage classes to projects.

    **Note**: If the default storage classes don't meet requirements, create new storage classes following the above steps and modify parameters as needed. See [Available Storage Class Parameters](#available-storage-class-parameters).
