* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is Amazon's managed Kubernetes service for running Kubernetes on AWS Cloud and on-premises data centers. In the cloud, Amazon EKS automatically manages the availability and scalability of Kubernetes control plane nodes responsible for scheduling containers, managing application availability, storing cluster data, and other critical tasks, providing a consistent and fully supported Kubernetes solution.

* Huawei Cloud Container Engine (CCE) provides highly reliable, high-performance enterprise-level container application management services, supporting Kubernetes community native applications and tools, simplifying the construction of automated container runtime environments on the cloud.

* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides the fastest way to start developing and deploying cloud-native applications on Azure, data centers, or edge using built-in code-to-cloud pipelines and guardrails, with unified management and governance for on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters.

* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides an extremely scalable, fully automated Kubernetes service that can be used with almost no Kubernetes expertise required. Its advantages include increased speed, reduced risk, and lower total cost of ownership, with built-in security posture and observability tools, and industry-leading autoscaling solutions that can scale up to 15,000 nodes.
