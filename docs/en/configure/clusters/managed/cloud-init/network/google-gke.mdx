## Support Overview

| Feature | Support Status | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **LoadBalancer Service** | Default Support | No additional deployment required. |
| **Ingress** | Default Support | Optionally enable **Ingress Class** functionality (once enabled, you can manually select ingress classes when creating ingress through the form interface). No additional deployment required. |

## Prerequisites

If you have created a GKE cluster, [import the GKE cluster](/configure/clusters/managed/import/gcp-gke.mdx).
    {/* if not, [create a Google GKE cluster](/configure/clusters/managed/create/gcp-gke.mdx). */}

## Configuration Steps

### Deploy Ingress Controller

No manual deployment is required. GKE provides a managed built-in Ingress controller called GKE Ingress. This controller maps Ingress resources to Google Cloud Load Balancers to handle HTTP(S) workloads in GKE, making configuration simpler and more automated.

### Create Ingress and LoadBalancer Services

You can create ingress and LoadBalancer services simultaneously or choose one based on your needs.

**Create Ingress**

1. In **Container Platform**, click **Network** > **Ingress** in the left navigation.

2. Click **Create Ingress** and select **GKE Ingress Class** for **Ingress Class**.
    
3. Select **Protocol**. Default is **HTTP**. For **HTTPS**, first [create a certificate](#create-certificate) and select it.

4. Click **Create**. Wait approximately 5 minutes for GKE platform to automatically assign a public IP address to the ingress.

    **Note**: Different ingress resources will be assigned different public IP addresses.
    
**Create LoadBalancer Service**

1. In **Container Platform**, click **Network** > **Services** in the left navigation.

2. Click **Create Service** and select **LoadBalancer** for **External Access**.

3. Expand **annotations** and fill in LoadBalancer service annotations as needed.

4. Click **Create**.

### View Ingress Resources in Google Cloud

1. Go to **Google Cloud > Kubernetes Engine** and click **Services and Ingress** in the left navigation.

2. Click **INGRESS**.

3. View information about corresponding Ingress resources in the list.

### Create Certificate

When using HTTPS protocol, save HTTPS certificate credentials as a Secret (TLS type) in advance.

1. In **Container Platform**, click **Configuration** > **Secrets** in the left navigation.

2. Click **Create Secret**.

3. Select **TLS** type and import or fill in **Certificate** and **Private Key** as needed.

4. Click **Create**.
