# Import Amazon EKS Cluster

Connect an existing Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster to the platform for unified management.

## Prerequisites

* The cluster's Kubernetes version and settings meet the requirements in [Version compatibility for importing standard Kubernetes clusters](/configure/clusters/overview.mdx#version-compatibility).

* The image registry must support HTTPS and provide a valid TLS certificate issued by a public CA.

## Prepare the environment

To comply with AWS EKS security practices, perform the following steps in AWS CloudShell.

1. Ensure network connectivity to the AWS Management Console.

2. Search for `cloudshell`, then open [CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home).

3. Verify that the selected region matches your target cluster's region; switch if needed.

4. After CloudShell is ready, clear the terminal and run:

    ```shell
    # List clusters in the current region and verify your permissions
    aws eks list-clusters

    # <region-code> is the region of the cluster, e.g., us-west-1
    # <my-cluster> is the cluster name from the previous output
    aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region-code> --name <my-cluster>

    # The kubeconfig file is saved to "${HOME}/.kube/config"
    # Save its content to a file, then upload it to the platform for parsing
    cat "${HOME}/.kube/config"
    ```

5. The environment is now ready. For subsequent steps such as **Get cluster information** and **Import cluster**, run any commands against the target cluster from within CloudShell.

## Get cluster information

### Get the import token

KubeConfig from publicâ€‘cloud clusters cannot be used directly for import.

Refer to [How do I get cluster information?](/configure/clusters/how-to/fetch-kubeconfig.mdx) to obtain the cluster import token.

## Import the cluster

1. In the left navigation, go to **Cluster Management** > **Clusters**.

2. Click **Import Cluster**.

3. Configure the parameters as follows.

    |   Parameter |    Description    |
    | ------ | -------- |
    |  **Image registry**  | Registry that stores platform component images required by the cluster. **- Platform default**: the registry configured when the global cluster was deployed. **- Private registry**: a pre-provisioned registry hosting required images. Provide the **private registry address**, **port**, **username**, and **password**. **- Public registry**: a public internet registry. Before use, obtain credentials as described in [Update public registry cloud credentials](/configure/clusters/how-to/update_public_repository_credentials.mdx). |
    |  **Cluster information**  | **Tip**: Upload the kubeconfig file and let the platform parse it automatically. **Cluster endpoint**: the external API server address exposed by the target cluster. **CA certificate**: the cluster's CA certificate. **Authentication**: use the **token** created in the previous step with **cluster administrator** privileges. |

4. Click **Check connectivity** to verify network connectivity and automatically detect the cluster type. The detected type appears as a badge in the top-right of the form.

5. After the connectivity check passes, click **Import**, then confirm.

    **Tips**:

    * For clusters in the **Importing** state, click the details icon to view progress in the **Execution progress** dialog (`status.conditions`).
    * After a successful import, the cluster list shows key information. The cluster status is Normal and cluster operations are available.

## Network configuration

Ensure the global cluster and the imported cluster have network connectivity. See [Network Configuration for Imported Clusters](/configure/clusters/how-to/annotate-platform-url.mdx).

### Initialize Ingress and storage

If you need Ingress and storage capabilities, see [Initialize Ingress for AWS EKS](/configure/clusters/managed/cloud-init/network/aws-eks-lb.mdx) and [Initialize storage for AWS EKS](/configure/clusters/managed/cloud-init/storage/aws-eks.mdx).



## FAQ

### The Add Node button is disabled after import. How can I add nodes?

Adding nodes from the platform UI is not supported. Please add nodes through your cluster provider.

### Which certificates are supported by certificate management for imported clusters?

1. **Kubernetes certificates**: You can view the API server certificate only. Other Kubernetes certificates are not visible and are not auto-rotated.

2. **Platform component certificates**: Visible in the platform and support automatic rotation.

### What features are not supported for imported **AWS EKS clusters**?

* Audit data is not available.

* ETCD, Scheduler, and Controller Manager metrics are not supported; a subset of API server charts is available.

* Certificate details other than the Kubernetes API server certificate are not available.
