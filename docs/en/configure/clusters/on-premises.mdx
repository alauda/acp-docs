# Creating an On-Premise Cluster

## Prerequisites

### Node Requirements

1. If you downloaded a single-architecture installation package from [Download Installation Package](/install/prepare/download.mdx#download_core_package), ensure your node machines have the same architecture as the package. Otherwise, nodes won't start due to missing architecture-specific images.
2. Verify that your node operating system and kernel are supported. See [Supported OS and Kernels](/install/prepare/node_preprocessing.mdx#supported_os_and_kernels) for details.
3. Perform availability checks on node machines. For specific check items, refer to [Node Preprocessing > Node Checks](/install/prepare/node_preprocessing.mdx#node_checks).
4. If node machine IPs cannot be directly accessed via SSH, provide a SOCKS5 proxy for the nodes. The `global` cluster will access nodes through this proxy service.

### Load Balancing

For production environments, a load balancer is required for cluster control plane nodes to ensure high availability.

If a hardware LoadBalancer is available in your environment, it is **recommended** to use it.
If not, you can enable `Self-built VIP`, which provides software load balancing using keepalived.

**Recommendation**: When using a hardware LoadBalancer, configuring the Cluster Endpoint with a domain name is recommended. If the hardware LoadBalancer VIP changes after cluster installation, you can update the DNS record instead of reconfiguring the cluster.

**Note**: `Self-built VIP` does not support domain name configuration.

The load balancer must correctly forward traffic to ports `6443`, `11780`, and `11781` on all control plane nodes in the cluster.

If your cluster has only one control plane node and you use that node's IP as the Cluster Endpoint parameter, the cluster cannot be scaled from a single node to a highly available multi-node setup later. Therefore, we recommend providing a load balancer even for single-node clusters.

When enabling `Self-built VIP`, you need to prepare:

1. An available VRID
2. A host network that supports the VRRP protocol
3. All control plane nodes and the VIP must be on the same subnet, and the VIP must be different from any node IP.

### Connecting `global` Cluster and Workload Cluster

The platform requires mutual access between the `global` cluster and workload clusters. If they're not on the same network, you need to:

1. Provide `External Access` for the workload cluster to ensure the `global` cluster can access it. Network requirements must ensure `global` can access ports `6443`, `11780`, and `11781` on all control plane nodes.
2. Add an additional address to `global` that the workload cluster can access. When creating a workload cluster, add this address to the cluster's annotations with the key `cpaas.io/platform-url` and the value set to the public access address of `global`.

### Image Registry

Cluster images support Platform Built-in, Private Repository, and Public Repository options.

- **Platform Built-in**: Uses the image registry provided by the `global` cluster. If the cluster cannot access `global`, see [Add External Address for Built-in Registry](/configure/clusters/how-to/add_external_addr_for_global_registry.mdx).
- **Private Repository**: Uses your own image registry. For details on pushing required images to your registry, contact technical support.
- **Public Repository**: Uses the platform's public image registry. Before using, complete [Updating Public Repository Credentials](/configure/clusters/how-to/update_public_repository_credentials.mdx).

### Container Networking

If you plan to use Kube-OVN's Underlay for your cluster, refer to [Preparing Kube-OVN Underlay Physical Network](/configure/networking/how_to/kube_ovn/kubeovn_underlay_py.mdx).

## Creation Procedure

1. Enter the **Administrator** view, and click **Clusters/Clusters** in the left navigation bar.

2. Click **Create Cluster**.

3. Configure the following sections according to the instructions below: Basic Info, Container Network, Node Settings, and Extended Parameters.

  <Tab label="Kube-OVN">
  An enterprise-grade Cloud Native Kubernetes container network orchestration system developed by Alauda. It brings mature networking capabilities from the OpenStack domain to Kubernetes, supporting cross-cloud network management, traditional network architecture and infrastructure interconnection, and edge cluster deployment scenarios, while greatly enhancing Kubernetes container network security, management efficiency, and performance.

It can directly allocate physical network addresses to Pods, ensuring better performance and connectivity with the physical network. Nodes in an Underlay subnet must have multiple NICs, and the NIC used for bridge networking must be exclusively used by Underlay and not carry other traffic like SSH. When creating an Underlay default subnet, the cluster NIC is actually a default NIC for bridge networking, and the node NIC is the node NIC configuration in the bridge network.<br />

<Tab label="Flannel">
  Flannel provides a flat network environment for all containers in the cluster,
  giving containers created on different node hosts a unique virtual IP address
  across the entire cluster. The pod subnet is divided evenly among the cluster
  nodes according to the mask, and pods on each node are assigned IP addresses
  from the segment allocated to that node. This improves communication
  efficiency between containers without having to consider IP translation
  issues.

### Extended Parameters

**Note**:

- Apart from required configurations, it's not recommended to set extended parameters, as incorrect settings may make the cluster unavailable and cannot be modified after cluster creation.

- If a entered **Key** duplicates a default parameter **Key**, it will override the default configuration.

**Procedure**

1. Click **Extended Parameters** to expand the extended parameter configuration area. You can optionally set the following extended parameters for the cluster:

    <th style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>Parameter</th>
    <th style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>Description</th>

      parameter is entered, a default <b>Kubelet Parameter</b> configuration
      with the key <code>max-pods</code> and a value of <b>Node IP Count</b> is
      automatically generated. This sets the maximum number of pods that can run
      on any node in the cluster. This configuration is not displayed in the
      interface.
      <br />
      Adding a new <code>max-pods: maximum number of runnable pods</code>{' '}
      key-value pair in the <b>Kubelet Parameters</b> area will override the
      default value. Any positive integer is allowed, but it's recommended to
      use the default value (Node IP Count) or enter a value not exceeding{' '}

  </tr>
</table>

4. Click **Create**. You'll return to the cluster list page where the cluster will be in the **Creating** state.

## Post-Creation Steps

### Viewing Creation Progress

On the cluster list page, you can view the list of created clusters. For clusters in the **Creating** state, you can check the execution progress.

**Procedure**

1. Click the small icon **View Execution Progress** to the right of the cluster status.

2. In the execution progress dialog that appears, you can view the cluster's execution progress (status.conditions).

   **Tip**: When a certain type is in progress or in a failed state with a reason, hover your cursor over the corresponding reason (shown in blue text) to view detailed information about the reason (status.conditions.reason).

### Associating with Projects

After the cluster is created, you can add it to projects in the project management view.
