# Create a Bucket Request

Use a **Bucket Request**  to dynamically create a bucket based on an **Object Storage Class** and automatically bind the two.

## Prerequisites

* **Install** the **Alauda Container Platform COSI** cluster.
* **Install** either the **Alauda Container Platform COSI for Ceph** or the **Alauda Container Platform COSI for MinIO** cluster plugin package, depending on which object storage solution you plan to use.

For detailed installation steps, see **[Installing](/configure/storage/cosi/install.mdx)**.

## Procedure

1. Switch to the **Container Platform** view.

2. In the left navigation, click **Storage > Bucket Claims**.

3. Click **Create a Bucket Request**.

4. Configure the parameters as follows.

   | Parameter                | Description                                                                               |
   | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Name**                 | The name of the bucket request.                                                           |
   | **Object Storage Class** | The Object Storage Class used to dynamically create the bucket and establish the binding. |

5. Click **Create**. Wait until the status becomes `Available`, which indicates the request has been fulfilled and the binding is complete.

From the bucket request details page, click **Actions** (upper-right) to **Delete bucket policy** if needed. **Warning:** deleting the bucket policy clears all data in the bucket. Proceed with caution and confirm data backup and security requirements before deletion.
