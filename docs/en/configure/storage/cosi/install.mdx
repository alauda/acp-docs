### Constraints and Limitations

* Plugins are scoped to the current cluster only. You must install the required plugins individually on each cluster where you want to enable COSI features.
* The **Alauda Container Platform COSI for Ceph** and **Alauda Container Platform COSI for MinIO** both depend on the **Alauda Container Platform COSI** plugin. Ensure that the **Alauda Container Platform COSI** plugin is installed first.

1. Log in to the platform and navigate to the **Platform Management** page.
2. Go to **Marketplace** > **Cluster Plugins** to access the list of available cluster plugins.
3. Select the target cluster where you want to install the plugins.
4. Locate the **Alauda Container Platform COSI** plugin and select **Install** from the **⋮** menu to start the installation.
5. Locate and install the **Alauda Container Platform COSI for Ceph** or **Alauda Container Platform COSI for MinIO** plugin, based on your chosen backend.
6. Wait until the status of all plugins changes to **Installed**.

## Uninstallation

1. Log in to the platform and navigate to the **Platform Management** page.
2. Go to **Marketplace** > **Cluster Plugins** to access the list of installed cluster plugins.
3. Select the target cluster where you want to remove plugins.
4. Locate the plugin you want to uninstall and select **Uninstall** from the **⋮** menu to start the uninstallation process.
5. Wait until the plugin status changes to **Ready**, indicating that it can be reinstalled if required.

**Important:** Before uninstalling the **Alauda Container Platform COSI** plugin, you must first uninstall the **Alauda Container Platform COSI for Ceph** and/or **Alauda Container Platform COSI for MinIO**.
