# Create CephFS File Storage Type Storage Class

CephFS file storage is a built-in Ceph file storage system that provides the platform with a Container Storage Interface (CSI)-based storage access method, offering a secure, reliable, and scalable shared file storage service suitable for scenarios such as file sharing and data backup. Before proceeding, you must first create a CephFS file storage class.

After binding the storage class in a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), the platform will dynamically create persistent volumes on the nodes according to the persistent volume claim for business applications.

## Deploy Volume Plugin

After clicking **Deploy**, on the **Distributed Storage** page, [Create Storage Service](/storage/storagesystem_ceph/installation/create_service_stand.mdx) or [Access Storage Service](/storage/storagesystem_ceph/functions/access_storage_service.mdx).

## Create Storage Class

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Storage Classes**.

3. Click **Create Storage Class**.

   **Note**: The following content is provided as an example in form format; you may also choose to create it using YAML.

4. Select **CephFS File Storage** and click **Next**.

5. Configure the relevant parameters according to the following instructions.

   | Parameter        | Description                                                                                                            |
   |------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Reclaim Policy**   | The reclaim policy for persistent volumes.<br />- Delete: When the persistent volume claim is deleted, the bound persistent volume will also be deleted.<br />- Retain: The bound persistent volume will remain, even if the persistent volume claim is deleted.                         |
   | **Access Modes** | All access modes supported by the current storage. Only one of these modes can be selected when declaring persistent volumes later.<br />- ReadWriteOnce (RWO): Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.<br />- ReadWriteMany (RWX): Can be mounted as read-write by multiple nodes. |
   | **Allocate Project** | Please allocate projects that can use this type of storage.<br />If there are currently no projects that need to use this type of storage, you may choose not to allocate them for now and update later.                                                  |

   **Tip**: The following parameters need to be set in the distributed storage and will be applied directly here.

   - Storage Cluster: The built-in Ceph storage cluster in the current cluster.

   - Storage Pool: The logical partition used for data storage in the storage cluster.

6. Click **Create**.
