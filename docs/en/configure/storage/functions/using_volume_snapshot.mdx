# Using Volume Snapshots

A volume snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a persistent volume claim (PVC) that can be used to configure new persistent volume claims (pre-filling with snapshot data) or to roll back existing persistent volume claims to a previous state, achieving the effect of backing up application data and restoring it as needed, thereby ensuring the reliability of application data.

## Prerequisites

- The administrator has deployed the volume snapshot component **Snapshot Controller** for the current cluster and enabled snapshot-related features in the storage cluster.

- The persistent volume claim must be created dynamically and its status must be **Bound**.

- The storage class bound to the persistent volume claim must support snapshot functionality, such as **CephRBD Built-in Storage**, **CephFS Built-in Storage**, or **TopoLVM**.

## Example VolumeSnapshot custom resource (CR)

This creates a snapshot of the example-pvc `PVC` using a CSI snapshot class.

```yaml
# example-snapshot.yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: example-pvc-20250527-111124
  namespace: k-1
  labels:
    snapshot.cpaas.io/sourcepvc: example-pvc
  annotations:
    cpaas.io/description: demo
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: csi-cephfs-snapshotclass
  source:
    persistentVolumeClaimName: example-pvc
```

## Creating Volume Snapshots by using th web console

### Creating a Volume Snapshot Based on a Specified Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)

**Method One**

1. Enter the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage > Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**.

3. Click the ⋮ next to the corresponding persistent volume claim in the list and select **Create Volume Snapshot**.

4. Fill in the snapshot description. This description can help you record the current state of the persistent volume, such as _Before Application Upgrade_.

5. Click **Create**. The time taken for the snapshot depends on network conditions and data volume; please be patient.

   When the snapshot changes to `Available` status, it indicates that the creation was successful.

**Method Two**

1. Enter the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage > Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**.

3. Click on the name of the persistent volume claim in the list.

4. Switch to the **Volume Snapshots** tab.

5. Click **Create Volume Snapshot**, and configure the relevant parameters as needed.

6. Click **Create**. The time taken for the snapshot depends on network conditions and data volume; please be patient.

   When the snapshot changes to `Available` status, it indicates that the creation was successful.

### Creating Volume Snapshots in a Custom Way

1. Enter the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage > Volume Snapshots**.

3. Click **Create Volume Snapshot**, and configure the relevant parameters as needed.

4. Click **Create**. The time taken for the snapshot depends on network conditions and data volume; please be patient.

   When the snapshot changes to `Available` status, it indicates that the creation was successful.

## Creating Volume Snapshots by using the CLI

```shell
kubectl apply -f example-snapshot.yaml
```

## Creating Persistent Volume Claims from Volume Snapshots

Currently, the platform only supports creating volume snapshots using PVCs created from storage classes with **Dynamic Provisioning**. You can create new PVCs based on that snapshot and bind them.

**Note**: The access modes supported when creating a PVC from a snapshot differ from those supported when creating a PVC from a storage class, as highlighted in **bold** in the table.

| Storage Class Used for Creating Volume Snapshots | Single Node Read-Write (RWO) | Multi-Node Read-Only (ROX) | Multi-Node Read-Write (RWX) |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **TopoLVM**                                      | Supported                    | Not Supported              | Not Supported               |
| **CephRBD Block Storage**                        | Supported                    | Not Supported              | Not Supported               |
| **CephFS File Storage**                          | Supported                    | **Supported**              | Supported                   |

### Method One

1. Enter the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage > Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**.

3. Click on the name of the persistent volume claim in the list.

4. Switch to the **Volume Snapshots** tab.

5. Click the ⋮ next to the corresponding volume snapshot in the list and select **Create Persistent Volume Claim**, configuring the relevant parameters.

6. Click **Create**.

### Method Two

1. Enter the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage > Volume Snapshots**.

3. Click the ⋮ next to the corresponding volume snapshot in the list and select **Create Persistent Volume Claim**, configuring the relevant parameters.

4. Click **Create**.
