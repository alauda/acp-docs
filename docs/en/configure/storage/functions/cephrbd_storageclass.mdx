# Creating CephRBD Block Storage Class

CephRBD block storage is a built-in Ceph block storage for the platform, providing a Container Storage Interface (CSI) based storage access method that can deliver high IOPS and low-latency storage services, suitable for scenarios such as databases and virtualization. Before using this, you need to create a CephRBD block storage class.

Once a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is bound to the storage class, the platform will dynamically create a Persistent Volume based on the Persistent Volume Claim for business applications to use.

## Deploy Volume Plugin

After clicking **Deploy**, on the **Distributed Storage** page, [create a storage service](/storage/storagesystem_ceph/installation/create_service_stand.mdx) or [access a storage service](/storage/storagesystem_ceph/functions/access_storage_service.mdx).

## Create Storage Class

1. Go to **Administrator**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Storage Classes**.

3. Click **Create Storage Class**.

   **Note**: The following content is an example in form format, you can also choose YAML to complete the operation.

4. Select **CephRBD Block Storage**, and click **Next**.

5. Configure the parameters as required.

   | Parameter          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
   | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **File System**    | Defaults to **EXT4**, which is a journaling file system for Linux, capable of providing extent file storage and processing large files. The filesystem capacity can reach 1 EiB, with supported file sizes up to 16 TiB.                                  |
   | **Reclaim Policy** | The reclaim policy for persistent volumes.<br />- Delete: The bound persistent volume will be deleted along with the persistent volume claim.<br />- Retain: The bound persistent volume will be retained even if the persistent volume claim is deleted. |
   | **Access Modes**   | Only supports ReadWriteOnce (RWO): it can be mounted by a single node in read-write mode.                                                                                                                                                                 |
   | **Assign Project** | Please assign projects that can use this type of storage.<br />If there are no projects currently needing this type of storage, you can choose not to assign one and update it later.                                                                     |

   **Tip**: The following parameters need to be set in distributed storage and will be directly applied here.

   - Storage Cluster: The built-in Ceph storage cluster in the current cluster.

   - Storage Pool: The logical partition used for storing data within the storage cluster.

6. Click **Create**.
