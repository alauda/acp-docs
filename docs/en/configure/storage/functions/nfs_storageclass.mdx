# Creating an NFS Shared Storage Class

Based on the community NFS CSI (Container Storage Interface) storage driver, it provides the capability to access multiple NFS storage systems or accounts.

Unlike the traditional client-server model of NFS access, NFS shared storage utilizes the community NFS CSI (Container Storage Interface) storage plugin, which is more aligned with Kubernetes design principles and allows client access to multiple servers.

## Prerequisites

- An NFS server must be configured, and its access methods must be obtained. Currently, the platform supports three NFS protocol versions: `v3`, `v4.0`, and `v4.1`. You can execute `nfsstat -s` on the server side to check the version information.

## Deploying the NFS Shared Storage Plugin

1. Enter **Administrator**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Storage Classes**.

3. Click **Create Storage Class**.

4. On the right side of **NFS Shared Storage**, click Deploy to navigate to the **Plugins** page.

5. On the right side of the **NFS** plugin, click â‹® > **Deploy**.

6. Wait for the deployment status to indicate **Deployment Successful** before completing the deployment.

   | **Service Address**      | The access address of the NFS server. For example: `192.168.2.11`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
   | **Path**                 | The mount path of the NFS file system on the server node. For example: `/nfs/data`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

   | **Reclaim Policy**       | The reclaim policy for the persistent volume.<br />- Delete: When the persistent volume claim is deleted, the bound persistent volume will also be deleted.<br />- Retain: Even if the persistent volume claim is deleted, the bound persistent volume will still be retained.                                                                                                                                        |
   | **Access Modes**         | All access modes supported by the current storage. During the subsequent declaration of persistent volumes, only one of these modes can be selected for mounting persistent volumes.<br />- ReadWriteOnce (RWO): Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.<br />- ReadWriteMany (RWX): Can be mounted as read-write by multiple nodes.<br />- ReadOnlyMany (ROX): Can be mounted as read-only by multiple nodes. |
   | **Allocated Projects**   | Please allocate the projects that can use this type of storage.<br />If there are currently no projects needing this type of storage, you may choose not to allocate any projects at this time and update them later.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
