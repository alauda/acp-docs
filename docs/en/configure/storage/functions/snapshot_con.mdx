# Deploy Volume Snapshot Component

A volume snapshot refers to a snapshot of a persistent volume, which is a copy of the persistent volume at a specific point in time. If the cluster uses persistent volumes that support snapshot functionality, the volume snapshot component can be deployed to enable this feature.

Currently, the platform only supports creating volume snapshots for PVCs that are **dynamically created** using storage classes. You can create new PVC bindings based on these snapshots.

**Tip**: The access modes supported when creating PVCs from snapshots differ from those supported when creating PVCs using storage classes, which are indicated in **bold** in the table below.

| Storage Class Used to Create Volume Snapshots | Single Node Read-Write (RWO) | Multi-Node Read-Only (ROX) | Multi-Node Read-Write (RWX) |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **TopoLVM**                     | Supported  | Not Supported | Not Supported |
| **CephRBD Block Storage**       | Supported  | Not Supported | Not Supported |
| **CephFS File Storage**         | Supported  | **Supported** | Supported  |

## Steps to Operate

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Storage Management** > **Volume Snapshots**.

3. Click on **Quick Deployment**, which will redirect you to the cluster plugin.

4. Click on the â‹® > **Deploy** next to **Snapshot Controller**, and wait for a moment until the deployment is successful.
