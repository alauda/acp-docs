# Introduction

Kubernetes offers a flexible and scalable storage mechanism for managing data persistence in containerized environments. By abstracting storage resources such as Volumes, PersistentVolumes, and PersistentVolumeClaims, Kubernetes decouples applications from underlying storage systems, enabling dynamic provisioning, automatic mounting, and persistent data across nodes.

Key features include support for multiple backend storage systems (e.g., local disks, NFS, cloud storage services), dynamic provisioning, access mode control (such as read/write permissions), and lifecycle managementâ€”meeting the storage needs of stateful applications. For enterprise-level workloads requiring high availability, data persistence, and multi-tenant isolation, Kubernetes storage is an essential foundational capability.

Kubernetes storage is designed for developers, operations engineers, and platform teams, helping them efficiently and securely manage data in containerized workloads.
