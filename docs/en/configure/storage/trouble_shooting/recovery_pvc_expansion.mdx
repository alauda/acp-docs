# Recover From PVC Expansion Failure

When PVC expansion fails in Kubernetes, administrators can manually recover the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) state and cancel the expansion request.

### Procedure

1. Modify the reclaim policy of the Persistent Volume (PV) bound to the PVC to `Retain`. To do this, edit the corresponding PV and set the `persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy` field to `Retain`.

2. Delete the original PVC.

3. Manually edit the PV to remove the `claimRef` entry from its specifications. This ensures that the new PVC can bind to this PV, changing the PV's status to `Available`.

4. Recreate a new PVC with a smaller size or a size supported by the underlying storage provider.

5. Explicitly specify the `volumeName` field in the new PVC to match the original PV name. This ensures that the new PVC accurately binds to the specified PV.

6. Finally, restore the original reclaim policy of the PV.

### Additional Tips

- Ensure that the `StorageClass` in use has volume expansion enabled by setting `allowVolumeExpansion` to `true`.
- Perform these actions carefully to avoid the risk of data loss.
