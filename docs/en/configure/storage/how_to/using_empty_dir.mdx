# Using an emptyDir

In Kubernetes, an emptyDir is a simple ephemeral volume type that provides temporary storage to a pod during its lifetime. It is created when a pod is assigned to a node, and deleted when the pod is removed from that node.

## Example emptyDir

This Pod creates a temporary volume mounted at /data, which is shared with the container.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: emptydir-demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "echo hello > /data/hello.txt && sleep 3600"]
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: cache-volume
  volumes:
    - name: cache-volume
      emptyDir: {}
```

## Optional Medium Setting

You can choose where the data is stored:

```yaml
emptyDir:
  medium: "Memory"
```

| Medium    | Description                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (default) | Uses node's disk, SSD or network storage, depending on your environment |
| `Memory`  | Uses RAM (`tmpfs`) for faster access (but volatile)                     |

## Key Characteristics

| Feature                  | Description                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Starts empty             | No data when created                                      |
| Shared across containers | Same volume can be used by multiple containers in the pod |
| Deleted with pod         | Volume is destroyed when the pod is removed               |
| Node-local               | Volume is stored on the node's local disk or memory       |
| Fast                     | Ideal for performance-sensitive scratch space             |

## Common Use Cases

- Caching intermediate build artifacts

- Buffering logs

- Temporary work directories

- Sharing data between containers in the same pod (like sidecars)
