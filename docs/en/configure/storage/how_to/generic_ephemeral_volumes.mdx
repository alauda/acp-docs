# Generic ephemeral volumes

Generic Ephemeral Volumes in Kubernetes are a feature that allows you to provision ephemeral (temporary), per-pod volumes using existing StorageClasses and CSI drivers, without needing to predefine PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).

They combine the flexibility of dynamic provisioning with the simplicity of pod-level volume declaration.

- They are temporary volumes that are automatically:

  - created when the Pod starts

  - deleted when the Pod terminates

- Use the same underlying mechanisms as PersistentVolumeClaim

- Require a CSI (Container Storage Interface) driver that supports dynamic provisioning

## Example ephemeral volumes

This automatically creates a temporary PVC for the Pod using the specified `StorageClass`.

```shell
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ephemeral-demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "echo hello > /data/hello.txt && sleep 3600"]
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: ephemeral-volume
  volumes:
    - name: ephemeral-volume
      ephemeral: # [!code callout]
        volumeClaimTemplate:
          metadata:
            labels:
              type: temporary
          spec:
            accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 1Gi
            storageClassName: standard
```

<Callouts>

1. `Pod` will create a `PVC` by using this template.

## Key features

| Feature                  | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ephemeral**            | Volume is deleted when the Pod is deleted                       |
| **Dynamic provisioning** | Backed by any CSI driver with dynamic provisioning              |
| **No separate PVC**      | VolumeClaim is embedded directly in the Pod spec                |
| **CSI-powered**          | Works with any compatible CSI driver (EBS, RBD, Longhorn, etc.) |

## When to Use Generic Ephemeral Volumes

- When you need temporary storage with features like:

  - Resizable volumes

  - Snapshots

  - Encryption

  - Non-node-local storage (e.g., cloud block storage)

- Ideal for:

  - Caching intermediate data

  - Temporary working directories

  - Pipelines, AI/ML workflows

## How Are They Different from emptyDir?

| Feature          | `emptyDir`                  | Generic Ephemeral Volume             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Backing storage  | Node's local disk or memory | Any CSI-supported backend            |
| Storage features | Basic                       | Supports snapshots, encryption, etc. |
| Use case         | Simple temporary storage    | Advanced ephemeral storage needs     |
| Reschedulable    | No (tied to node)           | Yes (if CSI volume is attachable)    |
