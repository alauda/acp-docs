# Upgrade Workload Clusters

After completing the upgrade of the global cluster, you can proceed to upgrade the workload clusters.
The workload cluster upgrade process is similar to that of the global cluster but requires attention to the following considerations:

- If your platform uses the **global disaster recovery (DR)** solution, you **must complete the upgrade of both the primary and standby global clusters** before upgrading any workload clusters.
- All **PostgreSQL** instances will be **automatically restarted** during the upgrade.
- For **MySQL-PXC**, **MySQL-MGR**, **Redis**, **Kafka**, and **RabbitMQ** instances configured with an **automatic update strategy**, the upgrade process includes a restart, which may lead to **temporary service disruption**.
- A maximum of **20 workload clusters** can be upgraded concurrently.

## Upgrade a workload cluster

:::warning
If you plan to upgrade the **Operator** and **Cluster Plugin** while upgrading the workload cluster, please push the corresponding packages to the corresponding cluster's registry in advance.

For bulk upload instructions, see [Push all packages at once](../extend/upload_package.mdx#push_all_packages).

After the command is executed, wait approximately **10–15 minutes** until the **upgrade available** icon appears in the **Functional Components** tab of the cluster.

<Steps>

### Upgrade the workload cluster

1. Log into the Web Console and switch to the **Administrator** view.
2. Navigate to **Clusters > Clusters**.
3. Select the **workload cluster** you want to upgrade and open its detail page.
4. Go to the **Functional Components** tab.
5. Click the **Upgrade** button.

If the upgrade program detects any custom configuration overrides, you will be prompted to confirm these settings. If you are unsure whether these overridden configurations may impact the upgrade, please contact technical support for assistance.

Once confirmed, a component upgrade dialog will appear.
Review the available updates and proceed with the upgrade.

:::warning
**Known Issue in ACP 4.2.1:**

This issue only affects upgrades from **ACP 4.2.0 to 4.2.1** and will be fixed in **ACP 4.2.2**. It only applies to **cluster plugins**, not the **Operator**.

After completing the upgrade in the **Functional Components** tab, the **Upgrade** button may still appear clickable for cluster plugins.

**Do NOT click the Upgrade button again for cluster plugins.** If you click it, you will see that the **Target** for cluster plugins that have already been upgraded to the new patch version is displayed as a lower version. Upgrading again will cause these cluster plugins to be downgraded to an older version.
