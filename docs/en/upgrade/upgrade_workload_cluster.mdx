# Upgrade Workload Clusters

After completing the upgrade of the global cluster, you can proceed to upgrade the workload clusters.
The workload cluster upgrade process is similar to that of the global cluster but requires attention to the following considerations:

* If your platform uses the **global disaster recovery (DR)** solution, you **must complete the upgrade of both the primary and standby global clusters** before upgrading any workload clusters.
* All **PostgreSQL** instances will be **automatically restarted** during the upgrade.
* For **MySQL-PXC**, **MySQL-MGR**, **Redis**, **Kafka**, and **RabbitMQ** instances configured with an **automatic update strategy**, the upgrade process includes a restart, which may lead to **temporary service disruption**.
* A maximum of **20 workload clusters** can be upgraded concurrently.

If you want to upgrade Operators and Cluster Plugins together with the cluster upgrade, you must upload the Extensions to the platform **before upgrading ACP Core** using **violet**.

For bulk upload instructions, see [Upload All Packages in a Directory](../extend/upload_package.mdx#upload_all_packages).

When using **`violet push`** on a **standby global cluster**, you must specify the `--dest-repo` parameter with the VIP of the standby cluster.
For details, see [Upload Packages in a Global DR Environment](../install/global_dr.mdx#upload_dr_packages).

## Upgrade a workload cluster

<Directive type="warning" title="WARNING">
If the platform has **Data Services** installed, you must also upgrade the related extensions when upgrading clusters.
For details, see [Upgrade Data Services](../appservice/upgrade.mdx).
</Directive>

1. Log into the Web Console and switch to the **Administrator** view.
2. Navigate to **Clusters > Clusters**.
3. Select the **workload cluster** you want to upgrade and open its detail page.
4. Go to the **Functional Components** tab.
5. Click the **Upgrade** button.

If the upgrade program detects any custom configuration overrides, you will be prompted to confirm these settings. If you are unsure whether these overridden configurations may impact the upgrade, please contact technical support for assistance.

Once confirmed, a component upgrade dialog will appear.
Review the available updates and proceed with the upgrade.

<Directive type="info" title="INFO">
Upgrading the Kubernetes version is optional.
However, since service disruptions may still occur during other component updates, we recommend including the Kubernetes upgrade to minimize future maintenance windows.
