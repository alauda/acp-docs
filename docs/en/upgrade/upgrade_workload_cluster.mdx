# Upgrade Workload Clusters

After completing the upgrade of the global cluster, you can proceed to upgrade the workload clusters.
The workload cluster upgrade process is similar to that of the global cluster but requires attention to the following considerations:

* If your platform uses the **global disaster recovery (DR)** solution, you **must complete the upgrade of both the primary and standby global clusters** before upgrading any workload clusters.
* All **PostgreSQL** instances will be **automatically restarted** during the upgrade.
* For **MySQL-PXC**, **MySQL-MGR**, **Redis**, **Kafka**, and **RabbitMQ** instances configured with an **automatic update strategy**, the upgrade process includes a restart, which may lead to **temporary service disruption**.
* A maximum of **20 workload clusters** can be upgraded concurrently.

## Upgrade a workload cluster

1. Log into the Web Console and switch to the **Administrator** view.
2. Navigate to **Clusters > Clusters**.
3. Select the **workload cluster** you want to upgrade and open its detail page.
4. Go to the **Functional Components** tab.
5. Click the **Upgrade** button.

If the upgrade program detects any custom configuration overrides, you will be prompted to confirm these settings. If you are unsure whether these overridden configurations may impact the upgrade, please contact technical support for assistance.

Once confirmed, a component upgrade dialog will appear.
Review the available updates and proceed with the upgrade.

<Directive type="info" title="INFO">
Upgrading the Kubernetes version is optional.
However, since service disruptions may still occur during other component updates, we recommend including the Kubernetes upgrade to minimize future maintenance windows.

## Upgrade DevOps toolchain (if installed)

If DevOps tools are installed in your cluster, you can upgrade them **after the cluster upgrade is complete**.

1. In the Web Console, switch to the **Administrator** view.
2. Navigate to **DevOps Toolchain** in the left-hand menu to open the **DevOps Console**.
3. In the DevOps Console, navigate to **DevOps Toolchain > Instances**.
4. Use the breadcrumb navigation at the top to switch between clusters.
5. If any tool instance shows an available upgrade, click the **Upgrade** icon in the **Actions** column.

## Upgrade service mesh (if installed)

If a service mesh is installed in any cluster, refer to the <ExternalSiteLink name="servicemeshv1" href="/upgrade.html" children="Service Mesh Upgrade Guide" /> for detailed upgrade instructions.
