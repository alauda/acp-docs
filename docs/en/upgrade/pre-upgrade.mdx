# Pre-Upgrade Preparation

**Supported upgrade paths:**

* **From `4.0` → `4.2`**
* **From `4.1` → `4.2`**

Before starting, ensure your current platform version is within the supported upgrade range.

## Important Notes

- The directory `/cpaas/minio` (global cluster control plane) must have at least **120 GB** of available disk space.
- Kubernetes version of all clusters must be **1.31**. If not, upgrade Kubernetes first.

### Run the Checklist

Contact technical support to obtain the **checklist script** and run it against the target platform to verify upgrade readiness.

### Download the Packages

From the **<Term name="company" /> Customer Portal**, download the **<Term name="productShort" /> Core Package**.

If you want to upgrade cluster **Extensions** during the upgrade, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the following path: [Marketplace - Batch Download - Upgrade - Post-ACP v4.0 Upgrades]
2. Download the `ac-get-app.sh` .
3. Upload the script to the control node of **Global** cluster in your environment.
4. Run the script with `bash ac-get-app.sh`.
5. After it finishes, import the generated `apps.yaml` back into the <Term name="company" /> Customer Portal to align the extensions list.

In addition, navigate to the **CLI Tools** section in the **<Term name="company" /> Customer Portal** and download the `violet` tool. This tool is required for uploading Extensions. For more information about `violet`, see [Upload Packages](../extend/upload_package.mdx).

:::warning

From v4.2, we add a new plugin called **Alauda Container Platform Log Essentails**. If you installed log storage plugin before, you need to upload this plugin before upgrading.
