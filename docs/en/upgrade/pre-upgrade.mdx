# Pre-Upgrade Preparation

The upgrade process for <Term name="productShort" /> from **3.x to 4.x** differs significantly from the upgrade process within the **4.x series**. The following sections describe these two upgrade paths separately:

* [Upgrade from 4.x](#upgrade_from_4.x)
* [Upgrade from 3.x](#upgrade_from_3.x)

**Supported upgrade paths:**

* **From `4.0` → `4.1`**
* **From `3.18` → `4.1`**
* **From `3.18` → `4.0`**
* **From `3.16` → `4.0`**

Before starting, ensure your current platform version is within the supported upgrade range.

## Important Notes

Starting from <Term name="productShort" /> **4.0**:

* The **Disaster Recovery (DR) environment** upgrade procedure has changed. See [Global DR Procedure](./upgrade_global_cluster.mdx#global_dr) for details.
* All custom periodic ETCD backup tasks will be deprecated. Before upgrading:

  * Back up and delete all ETCD backup tasks **except** `etcd-backup-default`.
  * Deleting a backup task will not remove any existing ETCD snapshots; only the task itself will be deleted.
  * After the upgrade, you can reconfigure the `etcd-backup-default` task as needed.
* **CostManager** and **Kubecost** are deprecated. If installed, they must be uninstalled before upgrading.

When upgrading the cluster **Kubernetes version to 1.31 or higher**, all running Pods will be **restarted**. This behavior is required due to changes in PodSpec fields introduced in Kubernetes 1.31 and cannot be avoided. For details, see Kubernetes issue [#129385](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/129385).

The directory `/cpaas/minio` (global cluster control plane) must have at least **120 GB** of available disk space.

## Upgrade from 4.x \{#upgrade_from_4.x}

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following requirements are met for your current version:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Upgrading from 4.1">
- Kubernetes version of all clusters must be **1.32**. If not, upgrade Kubernetes first.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Upgrading from 4.0">
- Kubernetes version of all clusters must be **1.31**. If not, upgrade Kubernetes first.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Run the Checklist

Contact technical support to obtain the **checklist script** and run it against the target platform to verify upgrade readiness.

### Download the Packages

From the **Custom Portal**, download the **<Term name="productShort" /> Core Package**.

If you want to upgrade cluster **Extensions** during the upgrade:,Please download the ac-get-apps.sh script from the Custom Portal under the [App Market - Batch Download - Upgrade] feature. Upload this script to the Global cluster in your environment and execute it using the bash command. After execution completes, import the output file apps.yaml into the Custom Portal to match the list of extensions you wish to upgrade.

In addition, navigate to the **CLI Tools** section in the **Custom Portal** and download the `violet` tool. This tool is required for uploading Extensions. For more information about `violet`, see [Upload Packages](../extend/upload_package.mdx).

## Upgrade from 3.x \{#upgrade_from_3.x}

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following requirements are met for your current version:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Upgrading from 3.18">
- Kubernetes version of all clusters must be **1.30**. If not, upgrade Kubernetes first.
- If Istio is installed, **all clusters with Istio must be upgraded to version 1.22** before proceeding. Note that Istio versions must comply with Kubernetes compatibility requirements; see the Service Mesh upgrade documentation for details. 
- If Elasticsearch log storage is installed, you must apply the solution **"How to Correct the Issue of Node Role Settings in Big Cluster Elasticsearch"** before upgrading. The solution is available in **Custom Portal > Knowledge**.  
</Tab>

<Tab label="Upgrading from 3.16">
- Kubernetes version of all clusters must be **1.28**. If not, upgrade Kubernetes first.
- If Istio is installed, **all clusters with Istio must be upgraded to version 1.20** before proceeding. Note that Istio versions must comply with Kubernetes compatibility requirements; see the Service Mesh upgrade documentation for details. 
- If ClickHouse log storage is installed, it must be uninstalled before the upgrade and reinstalled afterward.
