# Overview
This document is intended for system administrators with basic Linux knowledge and details the full upgrading process of the <Term name="productShort" /> `global` cluster.

In this document, the following terms will be used frequently, please pay attention to the distinction:

-   **`global` cluster**: Refers to the cluster responsible for core platform management tasks, such as cluster management and tenant management.
-   **Platform**: Usually refers to the container platform itself, a complete system that provides an application runtime environment and integrates container scheduling, management, networking, storage, and other functions. The **platform** is an overall concept that covers all components, including the `global` cluster and workload clusters.
