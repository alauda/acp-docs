# Overview

<Term name="productShort" /> upgrades consist of three parts:

1. Upgrading the **global cluster**
2. Upgrading **workload clusters**
3. Upgrading **Operators** and **Cluster Plugins**

Users must upgrade the **global cluster** before upgrading any **workload clusters**.

Upgrading Operators and Cluster Plugins is optional. These can be upgraded during the cluster upgrade process, or separately after the cluster upgrade is complete.

## Cluster Upgrade Feature

In the cluster details page, under **Functional Components**, the platform lists all components provided by the system.
When a new version is available, the **Upgrade** button becomes active, allowing the user to perform the upgrade.

## Notes

* **Kubernetes Version:**
  Kubernetes upgrades are supported only for **On-Premises Clusters**. For **Managed Clusters** (e.g., Amazon EKS, Azure AKS), Kubernetes upgrades must be performed through the respective cloud provider. See [Cluster Type](../configure/clusters/overview.mdx#cluster_type) for more information on the differences between **On-Premises Clusters** and **Managed Clusters**.

* **Operator:**
  Only Operators with **Source = <Term name="company" />** are listed and can be upgraded via the cluster upgrade feature. All other Operators are managed through the **OLM** component in the Marketplace and are not included in this process.

* **Cluster Plugin:**
  Platform-provided plugins can be upgraded through the cluster upgrade feature on **both** On-Premises and Managed Clusters, provided they are already installed.

* **DR (Disaster Recovery Environment):**
  A DR environment contains both a **primary global cluster** and a **standby global cluster**, whereas a standard <Term name="productShort" /> environment includes only one global cluster.

* **Primary global cluster:**
  Defined as the global cluster that the <Term name="productShort" /> access domain name resolves to.

* **Standby global cluster:**
  Defined as the global cluster that the <Term name="productShort" /> access domain name **does not** resolve to.
