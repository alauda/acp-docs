# Overview

This upgrade guide covers two parts: upgrading the **global cluster** and upgrading **workload clusters**.

For both global and workload clusters, a **Feature Components** tab is available on the cluster detail page. This tab lists all upgradable components when performing a cluster upgrade, including:

* the Kubernetes version
* the container runtime
* platform-provided cluster plugins and Operators

When a new version of any listed component becomes available, the **Upgrade** button will be enabled. Users can initiate the upgrade process by clicking the button.

<Directive type="info" title="INFO">
- **Kubernetes Version:** Kubernetes upgrades are only supported for **On-Premises Clusters**. For **Managed Clusters** (e.g., Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, Azure Kubernetes Service), Kubernetes upgrades must be performed through the respective cloud provider. For more information about the definitions and differences between **On-Premises Clusters** and **Managed Clusters**, see [Cluster Type](../configure/clusters/overview.mdx#cluster_type).
- **Operator:** Only **platform-provided Operators** are listed and can be upgraded via the cluster upgrade feature. **Third-party or user-installed Operators** are managed via the **OLM** component in the Marketplace and are not included in this upgrade process.
- **Cluster Plugin:** Platform-provided plugins can be upgraded through the cluster upgrade feature on **both** On-Premises and Managed Clusters, as long as they are installed.
- **DR:** DR is short of _Disaster Recovery Environment_. It has both primary global cluster & standby global cluster while a standard <Term name="productShort" /> environment would have just one global cluster.
- **primary global cluster:** The standby global cluster is roughly a replica of the primary global cluster. To distinguish between the two, hereby define the primary global cluster as the one that the <Term name="productShort" /> access domain name resolves to.
- **standby global cluster:** Hereby define the standby global cluster as the one that the <Term name="productShort" /> access domain name DOES NOT resolve to.
