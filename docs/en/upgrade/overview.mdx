# Overview

This upgrade guide covers two parts: upgrading the **global cluster** and upgrading **workload clusters**.

For both global and workload clusters, a **Feature Components** tab is available on the cluster detail page. This tab lists all upgradable components when performing a cluster upgrade, including:

* the Kubernetes version
* the container runtime
* platform-provided cluster plugins and Operators

When a new version of any listed component becomes available, the **Upgrade** button will be enabled. Users can initiate the upgrade process by clicking the button.

<Directive type="info" title="INFO">
- **Kubernetes Version:** Kubernetes upgrades are only supported for **On-Premises Clusters**. For **Managed Clusters** (e.g., EKS, AKS), Kubernetes upgrades must be performed through the respective cloud provider.
- **Operator:** Only **platform-provided Operators** are listed and can be upgraded via the cluster upgrade feature. **Third-party or user-installed Operators** are managed via the **OLM** component in the Marketplace and are not included in this upgrade process.
- **Cluster Plugin:** Platform-provided plugins can be upgraded through the cluster upgrade feature on **both** On-Premises and Managed Clusters, as long as they are installed.
