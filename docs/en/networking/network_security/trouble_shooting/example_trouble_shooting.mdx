Introduce common problems that users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is brief, it can be directly placed on a single page titled "Troubleshooting." If there is a lot of content, make "Troubleshooting" a directory, with each problem documented separately.

You can visit the [Troubleshooting Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to view the corresponding document example.

:::

# \<Title: Usually the problem name>

## Problem Description

Provide a detailed account of the environment in which the problem occurs, its impact scope, observed symptoms, and add the following auxiliary information as appropriate:

- Problem screenshots: Currently, it is recommended to use text descriptions first. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used. Users need to register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Relevant logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to the problem (can be a single confirmed cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause must meet the following conditions:

1. It must be a confirmed actual cause that has occurred and proven to lead to the problem, rather than a speculated or imagined cause.
2. Provide detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How this cause triggers the issue.
   - The specific mechanism and process of how the problem occurs.

## Troubleshooting (optional)

List the specific steps for troubleshooting the issue in detail. Through troubleshooting, users can identify the most likely or definitive causes among multiple reasons and apply appropriate solutions. Troubleshooting should be noted as follows:

- If there is only one root cause, troubleshooting steps need to be provided, preferably in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different troubleshooting steps, use a third-level heading to list each root cause, and provide detailed troubleshooting steps under each.

  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (this is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, the second-level title should be "Solution")

Specific precautions, prerequisites, and steps to resolve the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, then the second-level title should be "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes, and each root cause has a different solution, then each solution should have a separate second-level title such as "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," etc.

### Precautions (optional)

Precautions that need to be considered before starting the operation. Failure to read and understand this section may lead to operational failure or even more severe consequences.

### Prerequisites (optional)

Conditions that must be met before starting the operation steps.

### Steps for Operation (if there are no precautions or prerequisites, this third-level title can be omitted)

- The steps for operation are generally presented in an ordered list. If the steps are complex, additional headings can be added for differentiation, using fourth-level headings to list each step, with specific steps presented in ordered lists under each step.
- If operations are conducted on a container platform, list each detailed step of the operation; if the operations are performed on a third-party platform or other software, only provide the key steps.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if the instructions are too detailed, we cannot guarantee timely updates to the documentation as their interface changes, which may lead to numerous problems. To ensure the long-term availability of the documentation, the description of operational steps for third-party platforms should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Highlight core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid excessive reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain the general applicability and flexibility of the operational instructions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic flow of the operations.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (this is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be removed)

This section follows the same format as the solution for Root Cause 1, and will not be repeated here.

## Preventive Measures (optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the problem from occurring again (suggestions, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (optional)

This section can contain content used in the document that is not easily placed in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
