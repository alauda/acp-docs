:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Any "concepts" introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require a dedicated document, a brief explanation can be provided within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to provide a more comprehensive introduction.

You can access the [architecture document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view a sample document.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams regarding the functionality, which may contain the following content:

- Core components: such as Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., illustrating the relationships and roles among the various components in the diagram.
- Data flow: including introduced resources, dependencies among resources, and the process of how resources are consumed.
- Deployment architecture: for example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram explaining the meaning of the image and the role of each part included.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires a more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts."
