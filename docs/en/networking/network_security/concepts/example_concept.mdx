Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional module (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.).
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document for multiple concepts. Otherwise, it is advisable to introduce each concept in a separate document.
For obscure and complex concepts, it is recommended to separately write an article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more accessible explanation.

You can visit the [example concept document](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to see the corresponding document example.
