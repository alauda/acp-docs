# Introduction

## Domain Name

Set the domain name address used for external access to computing components.

The domain names created on the platform need to be resolved to the cluster's load balancing address before they can be accessed via the domain name. Therefore, you need to ensure that the domain name added to the platform has been successfully registered and that it points to the cluster's load balancing address through domain resolution.

Platform administrators can use the domain management feature to centrally manage the enterprise network domain resources for this platform, and achieve the allocation and management of domain resources between projects by binding the domain names to projects.

**Note**: Domain names created on the platform need to be resolved to the cluster's load balancing address before they can be accessed via the domain name. Therefore, you need to ensure that the domain name added to the platform has been successfully registered and that it points to the cluster's load balancing address through domain resolution.

Domain names that have been successfully created and allocated on the platform can be used in the following functional modules:

- Inbound Rules

- Custom Applications - Add Inbound Rules

- Load Balancer - Add Listening Port

# Certificate

Before providing external HTTPS access to the business through inbound rules or load balancers, you need to prepare a TLS certificate for the access domain name or address for HTTPS encryption.
