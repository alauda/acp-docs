# How to Solve Inter-node Communication Issues in ARM Environments?

When using lower kernel versions and certain domestic network cards, there may be an issue where the network card computes checksums incorrectly after enabling Checksum Offload. This can lead to communication failures between nodes in the Kube-OVN Overlay network. The specific solutions are as follows:

- **Solution 1: Upgrade the Kernel Version**. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel version to 4.19.90-25.16.v2101 or a higher version.

- **Solution 2: Disable Checksum Offload**. If it is not possible to immediately upgrade the kernel version and inter-node communication issues occur, you can disable the Checksum Offload for the physical network card using the following command.

  ```
  ethtool -K eth0 tx off
  ```
