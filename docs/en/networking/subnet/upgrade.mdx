:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade process, upgrade documentation must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted. 

The upgrade documentation should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback procedure, etc. 

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade documentation should be organized into a directory, offering distinct upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide"). 

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for examples of the corresponding documentation.
