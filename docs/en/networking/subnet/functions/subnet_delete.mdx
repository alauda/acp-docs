# Delete Subnet

## Notes

- When a subnet is deleted, if there are still container groups using the IPs within the subnet, the container groups can continue to run and the IP addresses will remain unchanged, but they will be unable to communicate over the network. The container groups can be rebuilt to use IPs within the default subnet, or assign a new subnet to the namespace where the container groups reside for usage.

- The default subnet cannot be deleted.

## Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network Management** > **Subnets**.

3. Click â‹® > **Delete**, and proceed with the deletion.
