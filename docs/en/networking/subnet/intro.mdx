1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section is the opening of product documentation or feature modules, providing an overall description of the product or functionality. It encompasses core concepts, main features, target users, and expected uses, offering readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We generally determine whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview in a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents. For single feature modules, they can be combined into one document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

There may be many points involved in the product or feature module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Serve as a starting point to provide a consistent perception, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Provide readers with a clear product background, facilitating deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: Reduce the time spent in repeating explanations about the basic understanding of the product.

3. How to Construct the Introduction Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding lengthy descriptions.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and main features.
- Targeted at Readers: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information that matters to them.

4. Special Aspects of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for functional module descriptions in documents. By structuring content organization and clearly expressing ideas, it helps the team better communicate the product functionality value, allowing users to quickly understand and utilize product features.

We will find some differences between product-level and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introduction 

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive and need to be described in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introduction 

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the features and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Besides the introduction itself, if other chapters are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

Here is a short description. Specifically introduce what the expected use of \<Product/Module Name> is. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications based on Kubernetes. It is at the core of ACP, built on a natively multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure to achieve unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the application migration process for enterprises, and effectively reducing operation and maintenance management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly set up an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
