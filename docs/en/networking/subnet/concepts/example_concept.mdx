Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional module (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). 
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document for multiple concepts; conversely, it is recommended to create a separate document for each concept. 
For obscure or complex concepts, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more accessible explanation.

You can visit the [concept document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to view examples of corresponding documents.
