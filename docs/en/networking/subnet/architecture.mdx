:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Concepts introduced in the architecture are suggested to be linked to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced concept is relatively simple and does not require a separate documentation introduction, it can be briefly explained within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory, allowing for a more thorough introduction.

You can access the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view the example document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality. The diagrams may include the following content:

- Core Components: For example, Operators, Tasks, Middleware, etc., illustrating the relationships and functions among various components within the diagram.
- Data Flow: Such as the introduced resources, dependencies among the resources, and the process of resource consumption.
- Deployment Architecture: For instance, multi-cluster deployments, high availability designs, etc.

Add a description of the image below the architecture diagram to explain its meaning and the roles of each part involved.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires a more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts."
