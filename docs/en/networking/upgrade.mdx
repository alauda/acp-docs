:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it is not necessary.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be structured into a directory, and different version upgrade documents should be provided within that directory (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide," "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.
