# Bind NIC in ALB

By default, ALB listens on `0.0.0.0` for ipv4 and `::` for ipv6. In certain security scenarios, it needs to be bound to a specific network interface card (NIC).

## For Cluster Embedded ALB

By default, an embedded ALB will be deployed in each cluster. In the global cluster, it should be named 'global-alb2', while in other clusters, it should be named 'cpaas-system'.

Replace `$CLUSTER` and `$NIC` with the actual cluster and NIC.
If you use Alive (Alauda Container Platform Virtual lP Management), you need add `alive` to the nic list.

```bash
kubectl annotate cluster -n cpaas-system $cluster cpaas.io/alb-bind-nic='{"nic":["$NIC","alive"]}'
```

By default, ALB enables IPv6 in a single-stack cluster. However, when using bindnic, the specified NIC might not have an IPv6 address. In such cases, ALB will still attempt to bind to `::*`.
As a workaround, you could disable IPv6.

```bash
kubectl annotate cluster -n cpaas-system $cluster cpaas.io/alb-enable-ipv6='"false"'
```

## For User-defined ALB

```bash
kubectl patch alb2 -n cpaas-system $ALB -p '{"spec":{"config":{"enableIPV6":"false","bindNIC":"{\"nic\":[\"$NIC\",\"alive\"]}"}}}' --type=merge
```
