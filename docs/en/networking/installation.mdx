:::tip

If the module needs to be deployed separately, deployment documentation is required; otherwise, it may not be necessary.

The deployment documentation should include the deployment process, deployment configurations, uninstallation procedures, and more. If the content of the documentation is extensive, it can be converted into a table of contents and split into multiple documents for discussion.

You can refer to the [deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) for examples of relevant documentation.
