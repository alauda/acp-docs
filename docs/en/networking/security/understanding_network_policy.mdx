# Understanding Network Policy APIs

## Introduction

Network security in Kubernetes-style clusters involves controlling which workloads (Pods, namespaces) can communicate and how. At its core are network-policy APIs that enable segmentation (layer 3/4) and traffic control. Over time more advanced API layers have emerged to support cluster-wide guardrails, multi-tenancy enforcement, zero-trust models and application-layer (layer 7) filtering.

This article focuses on the API model v1alpha1: AdminNetworkPolicy (ANP) and BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy (BANP), their place among network policy APIs, how they relate to the standard NetworkPolicy, and how you might use them today while planning for future versions.

## Evaluation of network policy by KUBE-OVN

When multiple network policies are applied, they follow a strict priority order: Admin Network Policy takes precedence over Network Policy, which in turn takes precedence over Baseline Admin Network Policy.

The procedure is as follows：

{/* cspell:words banp */}

## What is the difference between the AdminNetworkPolicy with scope and the NetworkPolicy with namespace scope?

| Dimension                 | Namespace-Scoped **NetworkPolicy**                  | Cluster-Scoped **AdminNetworkPolicy**                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**                 | Applies only to a single namespace                  | Applies across the entire cluster                                                  |
| **Audience / Ownership**  | Application developer or namespace owners           | Platform administrators or cluster administrator                                   |
| **Primary Use**           | Workload-level microsegmentation (L3/L4)            | Enforcing global or cross-namespace access rules                                   |
| **Control Target**        | Pods within a namespace selected by `podSelector`   | Namespaces or Pods selected by top-level `subject`                                 |
| **Policy Priority**       | Medium priority — evaluated after admin-level rules | Higher priority — overrides namespace policies                                     |
| **Typical Use Cases**     | Allow frontend → backend, restrict DB access, etc   | Restrict inter-tenant traffic, enforce egress restrictions, set global protections |
| **Visibility**            | Only affects the namespace where it is created      | Can impact multiple namespaces simultaneously                                      |
| **Cross-Namespace Rules** | Allowed only indirectly (via namespaceSelector)     | First-class cross-namespace traffic control                                        |
| **Risk Surface**          | Misconfiguration affects one namespace              | Misconfiguration may affect entire cluster traffic                                 |
