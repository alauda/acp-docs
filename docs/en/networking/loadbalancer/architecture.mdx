:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

It is recommended to link the "Concepts" introduced in the architecture to the corresponding chapter on "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "Concept" is relatively simple and does not require a separate document, a brief explanation can be provided in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory for a more thorough introduction.

You can refer to the [architecture document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) for a sample document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality. The diagrams may include the following content:

- Core Components: such as Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., illustrating the relationships and functions of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: including introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption.
- Deployment Architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description of the diagram below it, explaining the meaning of the image and the functions of its parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding chapter on "Core Concepts."
