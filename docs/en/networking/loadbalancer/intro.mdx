1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or feature module, providing an overall description of the product or function. It encompasses core concepts, main functions, target users, and intended uses, giving readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We generally decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview sections in the same document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for single feature modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

There may be many points involved in a product or feature module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: It can serve as a starting point to provide a consistent understanding, reducing communication discrepancies.
- Guide Reading: It provides a clear background of the product for readers, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repeatedly explaining the fundamental understanding of the product.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding redundancy.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functions of the product.
- Audience-Focused: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information that is relevant to them.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing feature modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the value of product features, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product functions.

There are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position and competitive advantages within the industry.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all the core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product are more comprehensive and need to be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Aside from this introduction section, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This section is a short description. Specifically introduce what the expected use of \<Product/Module Name> is. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications based on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, built on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure, and achieving unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the application migration process to the cloud and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly set up an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
