# Introduction

- Support Ingress and Gateway API: Users can flexibly choose to use Ingress or Gateway API based on their preferences.
- Flexible user-defined traffic rules: ALB provides a traffic rule DSL that supports more complex traffic matching and distribution scenarios than standard Ingress and Gateway API.
- Multi-protocol support: ALB can manage HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and UDP traffic.
