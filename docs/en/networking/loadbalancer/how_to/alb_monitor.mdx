# ALB Monitoring

## Terminology

| Term | Description                         |
| ---  | ----------------------------------- |
| ALB  | A self-developed layer-7 load balancer by the platform. |

## Operation Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Operation Center** > **Monitoring** > **Monitoring Dashboard**.

3. Click on **Cluster** at the top of the page to switch to the cluster you want to monitor.

4. Click on **Switch** in the upper right corner of the page.

5. You can enter the **ALB Status** monitoring dashboard through the following two methods:

   - Method 1: Click on the **container-platform** card to expand the monitoring directory, then click on the **ALB Status** name to enter the monitoring dashboard. You can set this monitoring dashboard as the main dashboard if needed.

   - Method 2: Enter a keyword (e.g., alb) in the search box and search, then click on the **ALB Status** name to enter the monitoring dashboard. You can set this monitoring dashboard as the main dashboard if needed.

6. View various monitoring metrics through the dashboard.

   - **Select the namespace to monitor**: Click on the **namespace** at the top of the page to select the namespace to monitor, defaulting to all, meaning monitoring all namespaces.

   - **Select the ALB to monitor**: Click on the **name** at the top of the page to select the ALB to monitor, defaulting to all, meaning monitoring all ALBs.

## Monitoring Metrics

Displays the monitoring metrics of total traffic, resource usage, Ingress (inbound rules), HTTPRoute (routing rules of type HTTPRoute), and Rule (rules that are neither Ingress nor HTTPRoute) for the selected ALB within the **last 5 minutes**.

**Note**: All data are monitoring data collected in the **last 5 minutes**.

### ALB Traffic Monitoring

| Monitoring Metric              | Description                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Active Connections**         | The number of active connections on the selected ALB. |
| **Requests Per Second**        | The total number of requests received per second on the selected ALB. |
| **Error Rate**                 | The proportion of 4XX (such as 404) and 5XX error requests occurring per second on the selected ALB. |
| **Latency**                    | The average latency of requests on the selected ALB. |

### ALB Resource Usage

| Monitoring Metric               | Description                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **CPU Usage**                   | The CPU usage of the selected ALB. |
| **Memory Usage**                | The memory usage of the selected ALB. |
| **Network Receive/Transmit**    | The network I/O throughput of the selected ALB. |
| **Disk Read/Write Rate**        | The disk I/O throughput of the selected ALB. |

### Ingress, HTTPRoute, Rule Traffic Monitoring

| Monitoring Metric                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **QPS (Queries Per Second)**                      | The number of requests received per second by the Ingress/HTTPRoute/Rule on the selected ALB, with the default unit being req/s.                                                                                |
| **Request BPS (Bytes Per Second)**               | The total size of requests received per second by the Ingress/HTTPRoute/Rule on the selected ALB.                                                                                                              |
| **Response BPS (Bytes Per Second)**              | The total size of responses sent by the Ingress/HTTPRoute/Rule on the selected ALB.                                                                                                                          |
| **Error Rate**                                    | The percentage of errors that occurred when processing requests by the Ingress/HTTPRoute/Rule on the selected ALB.                                                                                            |
| **P50, P90, P99**                                 | The response times for requests on the selected ALB, specifically the median response time. It indicates that 50%, 90%, and 99% of requests have a response time less than or equal to this value. <br /><br /><b>Note</b>: The principle of P50, P90, and P99 is to sort the collected data from smallest to largest and take the data values at the 50%, 90%, and 99% positions; thus, 50%, 90%, and 99% of the data collected are below this value. Percentiles help analyze the distribution of the data and identify various extreme situations. |
| **Upstream P50, Upstream P90, Upstream P99**     | The request response times for upstream services. It indicates that 50%, 90%, and 99% of requests sent to upstream services have response times less than or equal to this value.                                                                                  |
