# Deploy High Available VIP for ALB

The high availability of the **Load Balancer** requires a VIP. There are two ways to obtain a VIP.

## Method 1: Use LoadBalancer type internal routing to provide VIP

When creating a load balancer, the **internal routing** option is enabled, and the system automatically creates a LoadBalancer type internal routing to provide a VIP for the load balancer. Before using it, ensure that the current cluster supports LoadBalancer type internal routing. You can use the platform's built-in LoadBalancer internal routing implementation, for specific configuration, please refer to [External Address Pool](/networking/metallb/functions/create_metallb.mdx); if the **internal routing** option is disabled, you need to configure an access address for the load balancer.

## Method 2: Use external load balancer device to provide VIP

* Please confirm with the network engineer the IP address (public IP, private IP, VIP) or domain name of the load balancer service before deployment. If you want to use a domain name as the address for external traffic to access the load balancer, you need to apply for a domain name in advance and configure domain name resolution. It is recommended to use a commercial load balancer device to provide a VIP, if not, you can use the [Pure Software Data Center LB Solution (Alpha)](/networking/loadbalancer/how_to/deploy_pure_sofe_datacenter_lb.mdx)

* According to the business scenario, the external load balancer needs to configure health checks for all the ports in use to reduce the downtime of ALB upgrade. The health check configuration is as follows:

    | Health Check Parameters | Description      |
    | -------- | -------- |
    | **Port** | <ul><li>For global clusters, fill in: 11782.</li><li>For business clusters, fill in: 1936.</li></ul> |
    | **Protocol** | The protocol type of the health check, it is recommended to use TCP. |
    | **Response Timeout** | The time required to receive the health check response, it is recommended to configure it to 2 seconds. |
    | **Check Interval** | The time interval for the health check, it is recommended to configure it to 5 seconds. |
    | **Unhealthy Threshold** | The number of consecutive failures after which the health check status of the backend server is determined to be failed, it is recommended to configure it to 3 times. |
