# find who cause the error

The `X-ALB-ERR-REASON` field in the response header of the error request will indicate the reason for the error.

The error reason might be:
```bash
InvalidBalancer : no balancer found for xx # it means no endpoint found for the service
BackendError : read xxx byte data from backend # it means the backend did give response, the error code is not cause by alb.
InvalidUpstream : no rule match # it means the request does not match any rule, so alb return 404.
```
