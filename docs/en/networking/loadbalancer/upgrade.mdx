:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade process, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade procedure, upgrade configuration, rollback process, and so on.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade procedures between different versions, the upgrade document needs to be organized into a directory that provides the upgrade documents for different versions (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding document.
