Introduce common issues that users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is brief, it can be placed directly in a single page titled "Issue Handling". If the content is extensive, "Issue Handling" should serve as a directory, with each issue documented separately.

You can access the [Issue Handling Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) for corresponding document examples.

:::

# \<Title: Generally the name of the issue>

## Issue Description

Provide a detailed account of the environment in which the issue occurs, its scope of impact, and the observed symptoms. Additionally, include the following auxiliary information as appropriate:

- Screenshots of the issue: Text descriptions are currently preferred. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots may be used, and users need to register for discussion with the documentation team.
- Relevant logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to the occurrence of this issue (these can be a single confirmed cause or various possible causes). Each cause must meet the following criteria:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and been confirmed to lead to this issue, rather than speculative or imaginary causes.
2. Provide a detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How this cause triggers the issue.
   - The specific mechanism and process by which the issue occurs.

## Issue Troubleshooting (Optional)

List specific steps for troubleshooting the issue in detail. Troubleshooting can help users identify the most likely or certain cause among the multiple possibilities and apply appropriate solutions. Note the following for troubleshooting:

- If there is only one root cause, then troubleshooting steps must be provided, preferably presented in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes and the troubleshooting steps differ, use third-level headings to list each root cause, providing detailed troubleshooting steps under each root cause.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (this format is for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, the title of this second-level heading should be "Solution")

Specific considerations, prerequisites, and steps for resolving this issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level heading should be titled "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes with different corresponding solutions, each solution should be in its own second-level heading named "Solution for Root Cause 1", "Solution for Root Cause N", etc.

### Considerations (Optional)

Important considerations to be noted before starting the operations. Failing to read this carefully could lead to operational failure or even more severe consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that must be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (this third-level heading can be omitted if there are no considerations or prerequisites)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list; if there are multiple intricate steps, additional headings can be added to distinguish the steps, using fourth-level headings for each step and ordered lists for detailed steps beneath each.
- If the operation is being performed within a container platform, a detailed account of each step should be listed; if the operation involves a third-party platform or other software, only the key steps should be included.

  > Reason: For operations not on a container platform, if the description is too detailed, we cannot ensure timely updates in case of interface changes, potentially leading to various issues. To ensure the long-term usability of the documentation, descriptions of third-party platform operations should adhere to the following principles:
  >
  > - Focus on core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid excessive dependence on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the operational purpose and basic process.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (this format is for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level heading should be removed)

The content here should match the format of the solution for Root Cause 1, without further elaboration.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of this issue (recommendations, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can hold content that has been used in the document yet is not convenient to include in the main text, such as tools usage instructions, reference materials, etc.
