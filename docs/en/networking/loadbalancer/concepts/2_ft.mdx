# frontend
In the alb, we define a resource called frontend (abbreviated as ft), which is used to declare all the ports that all the alb should listen to.

## as l4 proxy 
For l4 proxy, we directly configure the backend service to be forwarded to on the ft.
## as l7 proxy
For l7 proxy, we could configure the default backend service in ft.
which means the alb will forward the request to this service if the request **could not match** any rule belong to this ft.
