# In-depth Understanding of Host Network Mode

Allows load balancer instances to directly reuse the node's network stack, sharing IP addresses and ports with the node. In this mode, load balancer instances bind directly to node ports without the need for port mapping and encapsulation conversion similar to container networks, resulting in optimal network performance.

**Note**: To avoid port conflicts, only one load balancer instance is allowed to be deployed on a single node.

### Related Description

- Load balancer instances listen to all network interfaces of the node by default, and can be accessed through any of the interface addresses.

- When creating a load balancer, the access address is the VIP address outside the cluster. The operation of the load balancer instance does not depend on this address, which has the following roles:

  - When creating a **native application**, it is combined with the access address to generate the **access address** for the application detail page.

  - After creating **inbound rules**, it generates the IP address in the `ingress` field of the YAML file.
