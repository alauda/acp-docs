# Network Observability

## About DeepFlow

### What is DeepFlow

The DeepFlow open-source project aims to provide deep observability for complex cloud-native and AI applications.
DeepFlow implemented Zero Code data collection with eBPF for metrics, distributed tracing,
request logs and function profiling, and is further integrated with SmartEncoding to achieve full-stack correlation
and efficient access to all observability data. With DeepFlow, cloud-native and AI applications automatically gain deep observability,
removing the heavy burden of developers continually instrumenting code and providing monitoring and diagnostic capabilities covering everything
from code to infrastructure for DevOps/SRE teams.

### Using eBPF Technology

Assuming you have a basic understanding of eBPF, it is a secure and efficient technology for extending kernel functionality
by running programs in a sandbox, a revolutionary innovation compared to traditional methods of modifying kernel source code
and writing kernel modules. eBPF programs are event-driven, and when the kernel or user programs pass through an eBPF Hook,
the corresponding eBPF program loaded at the Hook point will be executed.
The Linux kernel predefines a series of commonly used Hook points,
and you can also dynamically add custom Hook points in the kernel and applications using kprobe and uprobe technologies.
Thanks to Just-in-Time (JIT) technology, the execution efficiency of eBPF code can be comparable to native kernel code and kernel modules.
Thanks to the Verification mechanism, eBPF code will run safely without causing kernel crashes or entering infinite loops.

### Software Architecture

DeepFlow consists of two components, Agent and Server. An Agent runs in each K8s node, legacy host and cloud host,
and is responsible for AutoMetrics and AutoTracing data collection of all application processes on the host.
Server runs in a K8s cluster and provides Agent management, tag injection, data ingest and query services.

Additional notes on kernel versions:

<Callouts>

1. CentOS 7.9 and RedHat 7.6 have backported some eBPF capabilities (opens new window) into the 3.10 kernel.
   In these two distributions, the detailed kernel versions supported by DeepFlow are as follows \(dependent hook points\):
   - 3.10.0-957.el7.x86_64
   - 3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64
   - 3.10.0-1127.el7.x86_64
   - 3.10.0-1160.el7.x86_64
2. Golang/OpenSSL processes inside containers are not supported.
3. In kernel version 4.14, a tracepoint cannot be attached by multiple eBPF programs (e.g., two or more deepflow-agents cannot run simultaneously), this issue does not exist in other versions

</Callouts>

<Directive type="note" title="NOTE">
  RedHat's statement: > The eBPF in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 is provided as
  Tech Preview and thus doesn't come with full support and is not suitable for
  deployment in production. It is provided with the primary goal to gain wider
  exposure, and potentially move to full support in the future. eBPF in Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux 7.6 is enabled only for tracing purposes, which allows
  attaching eBPF programs to probes, tracepoints and perf events.

In summary, DeepFlow offers a comprehensive set of dashboards for monitoring and analyzing network
and application performance in both Kubernetes Pods and host networks.

- **Network**-prefixed dashboards provide L4-level metrics; **Application**-prefixed dashboards offer L7-level insights.
- Host-focused dashboards use **Cloud** or **Cloud Host** suffixes/names; Kubernetes-focused dashboards use **K8s** suffixes or lack the **Cloud** suffix.
- **Map**-suffixed dashboards visualize network or application topology.
- **Log**-suffixed dashboards display detailed logs for network flows or application requests.
- **Monitoring**-suffixed dashboards focus on specific protocols (DNS, SQL, Redis, Dubbo) and services.
- Distributed Tracing dashboards provide automatic tracing capabilities for applications requests.

#### Distributed Tracing

DeepFlow's Distributed Tracing feature allows you to trace requests as they propagate through various services and components in your applications.
This helps you identify performance bottlenecks, understand service interactions, and optimize application performance.

##### Panels

In the Distributed Tracing dashboards, you can view detailed information about each request, including:

- **Request List**: A list of all traced requests, including their IDs, timestamps, durations, and statuses.
- **Flame Graph**: A visual representation of the call stack for each request, showing the time spent in each service or component.

You can filter and search for specific requests based on various criteria, such as namespace, workload, trace ID, span ID, request resource, and time range.
Here is an example of a request list:

![Distributed Tracing - Request List](./assets/deepflow-request-list.png)

Click on a specific request to view its detailed trace information in the Flame Graph:

![Distributed Tracing - Flame Graph](./assets/deepflow-flame-graph.png)

A flame graph consists of multiple bar-shaped blocks, each representing a span.
The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents call stack depth. Spans are displayed from top to bottom in the order they are called.

Details are as follows:

- **Length**: Along the x-axis, represents the execution time of a span, with each end corresponding to the start and end times.
- **Service List**: Shows the proportion of latency consumed by each service. Clicking a service will highlight the corresponding spans in the flame graph.
  - **Color**: Application spans and system spans use a unique color for each service; all network spans are gray (as they do not belong to any service).
- **Display Information**: Each bar&#39;s display information consists of an icon, call information and execution time.
  - **Icon**: Differentiates span types:
    - <span
        style={{
          color: '#fff',
          backgroundColor: '#06c',
          borderRadius: '50%',

          display: 'inline-flex',
        }}
      >
        N
      </span>
      Network span, collected from network traffic via BPF, covering container
      network components such as iptables, ipvs, OvS, and LinuxBridge.
  - **Call Information**: Varies by span type:
    - **Application Span** and **System Span**: Application protocol, request type, and request resource.
    - **Network Span**: Observation point.
  - **Execution Time**: Total time consumed from span start to end.
- **Operations**: Supports hover and click.
  - **Hover**: Displays call information, instance information and execution time in a tooltip.
    - **Instance Information**: Varies by span type:
      - **Application Span**: Service and resource instance.
      - **System Span**: Process and resource instance.
      - **Network Span**: Network interface and resource instance.
    - **Execution Time**: The total execution time of the span and its proportion of self-execution time.
  - **Click**: Highlights the span and its parent span, and allows viewing detailed information of the clicked span.

##### Configuration

DeepFlow supports parsing unique Request IDs injected by applications (e.g., almost all gateways inject X-Request-ID) and associating different requests with the same Request ID into a single trace.
To add your Request ID header for parsing, you can modify the DeepFlow agent group configuration while installing or updating the DeepFlow plugin.

The configuration item is `processors.request_log.tag_extraction.tracing_tag.x_request_id`, which accepts a list of header names.
Here is an example configuration snippet:

```yaml
processors:
  request_log:
    tag_extraction:
      tracing_tag:
        x_request_id:
          - x-request-id
          - x-bfe-log-id
          - stgw-request-id
          - x-blb-request-id
```

For more details on configuring the DeepFlow agent, refer to the [DeepFlow Agent Configuration](https://deepflow.io/docs/configuration/agent/) documentation.
