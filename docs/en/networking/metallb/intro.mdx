1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or a functional module, providing an overall description of the product or functionality. It covers core concepts, main features, target users, and expected uses, giving readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We generally determine the presence of the Introduction, Advantages, and Features Overview sections based on the overall length of the document. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to split these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. The Importance of the Introduction

There can be many points involved in a product or functional module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Ensure unified understanding: It can serve as an opening that provides a consistent perception, reducing communication errors.
- Guide reading: It provides readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repeatedly explaining the foundational knowledge of the product.

3. How to Conceive the Introduction Section

- Concise and clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight key points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main features of the product.
- Audience-oriented: Consider the background of target readers and provide the information they care about.

4. The Special Features of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for functional module descriptions in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the value of product functionalities, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product features.

There are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Features of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functionality systems that the product includes.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product are more comprehensive, requiring a joint explanation based on the characteristics of different modules.

Features of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by a single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Beyond this introduction, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This is a short description. It specifically introduces the expected use of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module built on Kubernetes, aimed at cloud-native applications. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management across multiple clouds and clusters, greatly simplifying the enterprise application cloud migration process, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.
