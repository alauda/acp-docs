Introduce common problems users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is limited, it can be placed directly on a single page titled "Troubleshooting." If the content is more extensive, use "Troubleshooting" as an index, with each problem as a separate document.

You can visit the [Troubleshooting Documentation Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documentation.

# \<Title: Usually the Problem Name>

## Problem Description

Provide detailed information about the environment where the problem occurs, the scope of its impact, signs of the problem, and include the following supporting information as appropriate:

- Problem Screenshot: Currently, it is recommended to use a written description; if the text cannot describe the issue adequately, screenshots should be used. Users should register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Related Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debug information, etc., in code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual reasons that have led to this problem (can be a specific cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause needs to meet the following criteria:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and has been verified to lead to this problem, rather than a speculative or imagined reason.
2. Detailed causal analysis is required, including:
   - How this cause triggered the problem.
   - The specific mechanism and process by which the problem occurred.

## Problem Diagnosis (Optional)

Provide a detailed list of specific steps for diagnosing the problem. By diagnosing the issue, users can choose the most likely or certain cause from multiple possibilities and resolve the problem using the appropriate solution. Problem diagnosis should note:

- If there is only one root cause, provide diagnostic steps. In this case, it is recommended to present these steps in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Diagnostic Step 1
  ...
  n. Diagnostic Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different diagnostic steps, list each root cause using a third-level heading, and provide detailed diagnostic steps under each root cause.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Diagnostic Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnostic Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Diagnostic Step 1
    ...
    n. Diagnostic Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be named "Solution.")

Provide specific considerations, prerequisites, and steps to resolve the problem.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level title should be "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes with different solutions, each solution should have its own second-level title, such as "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," etc.

### Considerations (Optional)

Important precautions to take before starting the operations. Not reading this carefully may result in operational failures or even lead to more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that need to be met before beginning the steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level title can be omitted if there are no considerations or prerequisites)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list format; if the steps are complex, additional titles may be added between steps for distinction, utilizing fourth-level headings to list each step, with concrete steps shown in ordered lists beneath each.
- For operations conducted within a container platform, each step should detail every action taken; however, if operating on a third-party platform or other software, only the key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: Non-container platform operations, if written in excessive detail, may not be updated promptly if the interface changes, potentially leading to many issues. Therefore, to ensure the long-term usability of the documentation, the descriptions for third-party platform operational steps should adhere to the following principles:
  >
  > - Focus on core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid excessive reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users comprehend the purpose and basic flow of the operations.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be removed.)

This section follows the same structure as the solution for Root Cause 1 and will not be repeated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures (recommendations, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.) to prevent the recurrence of this problem.

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can include some content used in the documentation that is not conveniently placed in the main text, such as tool usage instructions, reference materials, etc.
