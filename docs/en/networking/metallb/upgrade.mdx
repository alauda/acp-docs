:::tip

If the parent module requires manual intervention for upgrade operations, an upgrade document should be provided; otherwise, it is not necessary.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback procedure, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for examples of the corresponding documents.
