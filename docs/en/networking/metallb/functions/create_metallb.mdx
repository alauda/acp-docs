# Create External IP Address Pool

An external IP address pool is a collection of IPs that MetalLB utilizes to obtain external access IPs for LoadBalancer type internal routes.

## Prerequisites

If you need to use a BGP type external IP address pool, please contact the administrator to enable the relevant features.

## Constraints and Limitations

The IP resources for the external address must meet the following conditions:

- The external address pool must be layer 2 (L2) interconnected with available nodes.

- The IPs must be usable by the platform and cannot include IPs already in use by the physical network, such as gateway IPs.

- There must be no overlap with the networks used by the cluster, including Cluster CIDR, Service CIDR, subnets, etc.

- In a dual-stack environment, ensure that both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses exist simultaneously in the same external address pool, and their counts are both greater than 0. Otherwise, dual-stack LoadBalancer type internal routes will not be able to obtain external access addresses.

- In an IPv6 environment, nodes' DNS must support IPv6; otherwise, the MetalLB plugin cannot be successfully deployed.

## Deploying the MetalLB Plugin

Using the external address pool relies on the MetalLB plugin.

### Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Cluster Management** > **Cluster**.

3. Click on the ***Cluster Name*** where the plugin is to be deployed.

4. On the **Plugins** tab, click on **MetalLB** to the right of â‹® > **Deploy**.

5. Wait until the deployment status shows **Deployment Successful** to complete the deployment.

## Create External IP Address Pool

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Network Management** > **External IP Address Pool**.

3. Click **Create External IP Address Pool**.

4. Refer to the following instructions to configure certain parameters.

   | Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Type**       | <ul><li>L2: Communication and forwarding based on MAC addresses, suitable for small-scale or local area networks that require simple and fast layer 2 switching, with advantages in simple configuration and low latency.</li><li>BGP (Alpha): Routing and forwarding based on IP addresses, using BGP protocol to exchange routing information, suitable for large-scale networks requiring complex routing across multiple autonomous systems, with advantages in high scalability and reliability.</li></ul>                                                            |
   | **IP Resources**| Support input in CIDR and IP range formats. Click **Add** to support multiple entries, examples as follows:<br />**CIDR**: `192.168.1.1/24`.<br />**IP Range**: `192.168.2.1` \~ `192.168.2.255`.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
   | **Available Nodes** | In L2 mode, available nodes are those used to carry all VIP traffic; in BGP mode, available nodes are those used to carry VIPs, establish BGP connections with peers, and announce routes externally. <ul><li><b>Node Name</b>: Select available nodes based on node names.</li><li><b>Label Selector</b>: Select available nodes based on labels.</li><li><b>Show Node Details</b>: View final available nodes in a list format.</li></ul><b>Note</b>: <ul><li>When using BGP type, the available nodes are the next-hop nodes; ensure that the selected available nodes are a subset of the [BGP Connection Nodes](./create_bgppeer.mdx).</li><li>You can configure either the label selector or the node name separately to choose available nodes; if both are configured simultaneously, the final available nodes are the intersection of both.</li></ul> |
   | **BGP Peers**  | Select BGP peers; please refer to [BGP Peers](./create_bgppeer.mdx) for specific configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
