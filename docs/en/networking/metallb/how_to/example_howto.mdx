1. Overview

The HowTo document is a practical technical document that focuses on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. It combines product features with real-world applications to provide users with complete guidance for solutions.

2. Document Features

HowTo documents have the following core features:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios.
- Highly practical: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a certain goal," emphasizing practical operation guidance.
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
- Replicability: Users can reproduce the solution in similar scenarios by following the document's steps.

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify the specific needs and pain points of users.
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution.
- Assess implementation conditions and possible limitations.

Audience Targeting

- Determine the target readers (e.g., developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.)
- Assess the technical background and knowledge level of the readers.
- Understand the working context and environment of the readers.
