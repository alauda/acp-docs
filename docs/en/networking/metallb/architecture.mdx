:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Concepts introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding sections in the "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced concepts are relatively simple and do not require a separate document for introduction, a brief explanation can be provided in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more detailed introduction.

You can refer to the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) for an example document.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to the functionality. The diagrams may contain the following content:

- Core components: such as Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., and illustrate the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data flow: such as introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and how resources are consumed.
- Deployment architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram to explain its meaning and the functions of each part.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in "Core Concepts".
