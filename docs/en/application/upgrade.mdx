:::tip

If the parent module needs to be upgraded manually, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it is not required.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, and more.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes for different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory that contains upgrade documents for each version (for example, "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.
