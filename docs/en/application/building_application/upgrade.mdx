:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, configuration for the upgrade, rollback procedures, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade process between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory, with separate upgrade documents for each version provided in that directory (for example, "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documents.
