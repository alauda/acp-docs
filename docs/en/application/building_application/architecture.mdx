:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" documentation is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Any "concepts" introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding chapter "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require a separate document for explanation, they may be briefly described within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory for a more thorough introduction.

You can visit the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to see example documentation.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality. The diagrams can contain the following elements:

- Core components: such as Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., and illustrate the relationships and functions of each component within the diagram.
- Data flow: such as introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption, among others.
- Deployment architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description under the architecture diagram explaining the meaning of the image and the role of each part within it.

Briefly introduce the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding chapter "Core Concepts".
