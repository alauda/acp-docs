# Creating a PVC

Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and set the parameters for the requested PersistentVolume (PV) as needed.

You can create a PersistentVolumeClaim either through a visual UI form or by using a custom YAML orchestration file.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that there is enough remaining **storage** quota in the namespace to satisfy the required storage size for this creation operation.

## Steps

1. Navigate to **Container Platform**.

2. Click on **Storage > PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)** in the left sidebar.

3. Click on **Create PersistentVolumeClaim**.

4. Configure the parameters as required.

   **Note**: The following content is provided as an example using the form method; you can also switch to YAML mode to complete the operation.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
   | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Name**   | The name of the PersistentVolumeClaim, which must be unique within the current namespace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | **Creation Method** | - Dynamic Creation: Dynamically generates a PersistentVolume based on the storage class and binds it. <br />- Static Binding: Matches and binds based on configured parameters and existing PersistentVolumes.                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | **Storage Class**  | After selecting the dynamic creation method, the platform will dynamically create the PersistentVolume as per the description in the specified storage class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
   | **Access Mode** | - ReadWriteOnce (RWO): Can be mounted by a single node in read-write mode. <br />- ReadWriteMany (RWX): Can be mounted by multiple nodes in read-write mode. <br />- ReadOnlyMany (ROX): Can be mounted by multiple nodes in read-only mode. <br /><br />**Tip**: It's recommended to consider the number of compute component instances that are planned to bind to the current PersistentVolumeClaim and the type of deployment controller. For example, when creating a multi-instance deployment (Deployment), since all instances use the same PersistentVolumeClaim, it is not advisable to choose the RWO access mode, which can only attach to a single node. |
   | **Capacity**   | The size of the requested PersistentVolume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
   | **Volume Mode**  | - Filesystem: Binds the PersistentVolume as a file directory mounted into the container group. This mode is available for any type of compute component. <br />- Block Device: Binds the PersistentVolume as a raw block device mounted into the container group. This mode is available only for virtual machines.                                                                                                                                                                               |
   | **More**   | - Labels <br />- Annotations <br />- Selector: After selecting the static binding method, you can use a selector to target PersistentVolumes that are labeled with specific tags. PersistentVolume labels can be used to denote special attributes of the storage, such as disk type or geographic location.                                                                                                                                                  |

5. Click on **Create**. Wait for the PersistentVolumeClaim to change to `Bound` status, indicating that the PersistentVolume has been successfully matched.

## Related Operations

- **Bind PersistentVolumeClaim**: When creating applications or computing components that require persistent data storage, bind the PersistentVolumeClaim to request a compliant PersistentVolume.

- **Create a PersistentVolumeClaim using Volume Snapshots**: This helps to back up application data and restore it as needed, ensuring the reliability of business application data. Please refer to [Using Volume Snapshots](../operation_after_creating/snapshot.mdx).

- **Delete PersistentVolumeClaim**: You can click the **Actions** button in the top right corner of the details page to delete the PersistentVolumeClaim as needed. Before deleting, please ensure that the PersistentVolumeClaim is not bound to any applications or computing components and that it does not contain any volume snapshots. After deleting the PersistentVolumeClaim, the platform will process the PersistentVolume according to the reclamation policy, which may clear data in the PersistentVolume and free storage resources. Please proceed with caution based on data security considerations.
