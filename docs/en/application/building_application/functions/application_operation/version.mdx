# Version Management for Native Applications

After updating the application through the platform interface, a historical version record is automatically generated. For application updates triggered by non-interface operations, such as updating the application via API calls, you can manually create a version snapshot to record the changes.

**Note**: When the number of version snapshot entries exceeds 6, the platform retains only the latest 6 entries and automatically deletes the others, prioritizing the removal of the oldest version snapshot entries.

## Creating a Version Snapshot

### Steps

1. Access **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click on ***Application Name***.

4. In the **Version Snapshot** tab, click **Create Version Snapshot**.

5. Configure the information and click **Confirm**.

   **Note**: You can also [Distribute the Application](./export.mdx), which allows you to distribute the version snapshot of the application as a Chart, facilitating the rapid deployment of the same application across multiple clusters and namespaces on the platform.

## Rolling Back to a Historical Version

Roll back the current application's configuration to a historical version.

### Steps

1. Access **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click on ***Application Name***.

4. In the **Historical Versions** tab, click on ***Version Number***.

5. Click â‹® > **Roll Back to This Version**.

6. Click **Roll Back**.
