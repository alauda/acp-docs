# Importing and Removing Resources for Native Applications

Native applications greatly facilitate the unified management of computing components, networks, storage, and configurations, but not all resources related to business belong to the application.

- Resources added during the application creation process, or added through application updates, are by default associated with the application and do not require additional importing.

- Resources created outside the application do not belong to the application and cannot be found in the application's details. However, as long as the resource definitions meet business requirements, the business can operate normally. In this case, it is recommended that you import the resources into the application for unified management.

Resources imported into the application can benefit from the following features:

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Version Snapshot**     | When [creating a version snapshot](./version.mdx) for the application, a snapshot will also be generated for the resources within the application. <ul><li>If the application is rolled back, the resources will also roll back to the state in the snapshot.</li><li>If a specific version of the application is distributed, the platform will automatically create the resources recorded in the snapshot upon redeploying the application.</li></ul> |
| **Deleted with Application** | If an application is no longer needed, deleting the application will automatically remove all resources associated with the application, including computing components, internal routes, and inbound rules.                                                                 |
| **Easier to Find**       | In the application detail information, you can quickly view the resources associated with the application. <br />For example: External traffic can access *Deployment D* through *Service S*, which belongs to *Application A*, but the corresponding access address can only be quickly found in the application details if *Service S* also belongs to *Application A*. |

## Importing Resources

Batch import related resources under the namespace where the application resides; a resource can belong to only one application.

### Steps to Operate

1. Enter **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click on ***Application Name***.

4. Click **Actions** > **Manage Resources**.

5. In the **Resource Type** at the bottom, select the type of resources to be imported.

   **Note**: Common resource types include Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet, Job, CronJob, Service, Ingress, PVC, ConfigMap, Secret, and HorizontalPodAutoscaler, which are displayed at the top; other resources are arranged in alphabetical order, and you can quickly query specific resource types by searching keywords.

6. In the **Resources** section, select the resources to be imported.

   **Attention**: For **Job** type resources, only tasks created through YAML are supported for import.

7. Click **Import Resources**.

## Removing / Batch Removing Resources

Removing / batch removing resources from an application only disassociates the application from the resources and does not delete the resources.

If there are interconnections between resources under an application, removing any resource from the application will not change the associations between the resources. For example, even if *Service S* is removed from *Application A*, external traffic can still access *Deployment D* through *Service S*.

### Steps to Operate

1. Enter **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click on ***Application Name***.

4. Click **Actions** > **Manage Resources**.

5. Click **Remove** on the right side of a resource to remove it; or select multiple resources at once, and click **Remove** at the top of the table to batch remove resources.
