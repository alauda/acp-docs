# Upgrade and Deletion of Template Applications

Due to overlapping functionality between the current template applications and native applications, and the enhanced operational capabilities available under native applications, independent management of template applications will no longer be offered in future versions. Please upgrade your currently successfully deployed template applications to native applications as soon as possible.

## Important Notes

This feature is **going to be discontinued**. Please upgrade your currently successfully deployed template applications to native applications as soon as possible.

## Prerequisites

Please contact the platform administrator to enable template application-related features.

## Upgrading Template Applications to Native Applications

You can upgrade a template application to a native application through the **Upgrade to Native Application** or **Update** operations. If an error occurs during the upgrade or update process, please adjust according to the error message displayed on the page and retry.

### Upgrade to Native Application

**Steps**

1. Go to the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **Template Applications**.

3. Click ⋮ > **Upgrade to Native Application**, and confirm. The platform will redirect to the **Application Management** > **Native Applications** page, where you can utilize features such as updating template versions, topology, version snapshots, logs, monitoring, and alerts. Afterwards, you will only need to manage the upgraded \[Native Application].

### Update

Updating the template application will also automatically upgrade the template application to a native application. After upgrading, you will have access to features such as updating template versions, topology, version snapshots, logs, monitoring, and alerts.

**Steps**

1. Go to the **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **Template Applications**.

3. Click ⋮ > **Update**.

4. Modify configurations.

5. Click **Update**.
