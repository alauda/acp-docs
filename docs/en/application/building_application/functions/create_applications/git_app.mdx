# Creating Native Applications Through Code

Creating native applications through code is implemented based on the S2I (Source to Image) technology. S2I is an automated image building framework that can directly convert source code into a runnable container image. This approach standardizes and automates the application building process, allowing developers to focus on business code development without worrying about the details of containerization.

## Prerequisites

Please contact the administrator to download and install the Source to Image Operator and create a Shipyard instance.

## Steps

1. Go to **Container Platform**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Application Management** > **Native Applications**.

3. Click **Create**.

4. Select the **Create through Code** method.

5. Refer to the parameter descriptions below to complete the configuration.

The Pod is responsible for the actual build work, including: pulling the source code from the repository, invoking the specified builder image, executing the build process, and pushing the build results to the specified image repository.</li></ol></td>
