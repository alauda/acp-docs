1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening for product documents or feature modules, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It encompasses core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and intended use, offering readers a clear preliminary understanding.

Typically, we decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview sections based on the overall length of the document. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it's recommended to split these contents into separate documents; for single feature modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

Given that there may be numerous points involved in a product or feature module, including an introduction can:

- Foster Unified Understanding: It can provide a consistent perception at the outset, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: It offers readers a clear background of the product, facilitating a deeper understanding of the subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: It minimizes the time spent on repetitive explanations of the product's basic understanding.

3. How to Construct the Introduction Section

- Be Concise and Clear: Use straightforward language to summarize the core points of the product, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling points and primary features.
- Consider the Audience: Take into account the background of the target audience and provide information that concerns them.

4. Unique Aspects of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing feature modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the product's functional value, enabling users to quickly understand and use the product features.

There are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems encompassed by the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive and need to be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the individual module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.
