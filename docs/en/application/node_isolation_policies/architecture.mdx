:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

It is recommended to link the "concepts" introduced in the architecture to the corresponding sections in the "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require separate documentation, they can be briefly explained in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to provide a deeper yet simplified introduction.

You can visit the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view sample documents.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this feature. The diagrams may include the following content:

- Core Components: For example, Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., illustrating the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: For example, the introduced resources, the dependencies between resources, and the flow of resources being consumed, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: For example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architectural diagram to explain its meaning and the roles of its components.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architectural diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts."
