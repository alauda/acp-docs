# Creating a Native Application through Code

> Using the platform's Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Builds product, deploy a container application based on the existing business application source code, and utilize the platform's **native application** to encapsulate it for complete lifecycle management of the application.

## Use Case

> The user only has the business application source code, managed through a code repository. Currently, they wish to containerize the business application. During the transition to the cloud, they can leverage the platform's S2I capability to realize the complete process from code to application.
