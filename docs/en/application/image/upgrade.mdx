:::tip

If this parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, upgrade documentation must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade documentation should include the upgrade process, upgrade configurations, rollback procedures, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade documentation should be organized into a directory, with separate upgrade documents for each version provided within that directory (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide," "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can refer to the [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for examples of the corresponding documentation.
