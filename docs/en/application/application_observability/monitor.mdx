# Monitoring

- Supports viewing resource monitoring data for computing components on the platform for the past ***7 days*** (configurable monitoring data retention period), including statistical data on applications, computing components, and container groups, as well as trends and rankings for resource usage such as CPU and memory.
- Supports cluster-based monitoring.
- The computable components that support viewing monitoring data include **Applications**, **Deployments**, **DaemonSets**, **StatefulSets**, and **Container Groups**. This document will use Deployments as an example for explanation.

## Namespace-Level Monitoring

1. In the left navigation bar, click on **Observability** > **Monitoring Dashboard**.

2. You can view monitoring data under the namespace; the platform provides three monitoring dashboards based on **Applications**, **Computing Components**, and **Container Groups**.

3. You can switch to any panel to monitor the resources of interest.

## Create a Monitoring Dashboard and Add It to Namespace-Level Monitoring

1. Under platform management, refer to [Create Monitoring Dashboard](../../observability/monitor/functions/manage_dashboard.mdx) to create a dedicated monitoring dashboard.
2. Adjust the following Label information to display the monitoring dashboard on the container platform:
   - `cpaas.io/dashboard.folder: container-platform`
   - `cpaas.io/dashboard.tag.overview: "true"`

## Monitoring Under Computing Components

> This section introduces viewing the real-time logs of containers via the Deployments page.

1. In the left navigation bar, click on **Computing Components** > **Deployments**.

2. Click on the name of the ***Deployment Resource*** in the list.

3. Switch to the **Monitoring** page to view the monitoring data of the **System Dashboard** within the expanded monitoring page.

## Monitoring Data Explanation

**Note**: Hovering the cursor over the chart curve allows you to view the detailed data of each container group at the current time point, as well as the PromQL expression. If there are more than 15 container groups, the values are sorted from largest to smallest and only the top 15 data entries are displayed.

| Monitoring Resource | Monitoring Data Granularity | Metric Explanation                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**             | Usage Rate / Usage Amount   | **Usage Rate** = Usage Value / Limit Value (limits)<br />You can determine whether the limit values configured for computing component containers are reasonable by checking the usage rate; if the usage rate is too high, it indicates that the limit values set for the container are too low, which may affect the normal operation of the computing component.<br />**Usage Amount** is the amount of resources used by the computing component. |
| **Memory**          | Usage Rate / Usage Amount   | **Usage Rate** = Usage Value / Limit Value (limits)<br />You can determine whether the limit values configured for computing component containers are reasonable by checking the usage rate; if the usage rate is too high, it indicates that the limit values set for the container are too low, which may affect the normal operation of the computing component.<br />**Usage Amount** is the amount of resources used by the computing component. |
| **Network Traffic** | Inbound / Outbound          | The network traffic flowing into/out of the container group per second.                                                                                           |
| **Network Packet Count** | Received / Sent         | The network packet count received/sent by the container group per second.                                                                                         |
| **Disk Rate**      | Read / Write                | The read/write rate of mounted partitions for each container group in the computing component.                                                                          |
| **Disk IOPS**      | Read / Write                | The Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) of the mounted partitions for each container group in the computing component.                                          |

4. Click the **Toggle Icon** to switch to the custom monitoring dashboard page and refer to [Create Monitoring Dashboard](../../observability/monitor/functions/manage_dashboard.mdx) to create a dedicated monitoring dashboard.
