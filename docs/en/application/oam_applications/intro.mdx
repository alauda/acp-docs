# Introduction

OAM applications provide a higher level of integration and abstraction for container and Kubernetes resources, enabling you to focus more on the development and operation of applications.

## What is OAM

The Open Application Model (OAM) is a model for defining cloud-native applications, focusing on the description of application standards. Unlike container or Kubernetes orchestration logic, OAM focuses more on the **application** itself.

- Open: Supports heterogeneous platforms, container runtimes, scheduling systems, cloud providers, hardware configurations, etc., independent of the underlying infrastructure.

- Application: Cloud-native applications that can reuse various infrastructures.

- Model: Defines standards to make it independent of the underlying platform.

## Why Use OAM

Cloud-native applications are collections of interrelated but discrete components that are instantiated with configurations within suitable infrastructures to achieve unified functionalities. However, the tightly interconnected nature of each component and functionality makes the processes of development, delivery, and management quite complex.

OAM provides a good abstraction system for upper-level applications, allowing complete replacement of the capability implementation layer without affecting the upper-level application, truly achieving independence from the infrastructure. Moreover, the core issue that the OAM model seeks to address is not how to write programs, but rather how to compose distributed applications, facilitating the easy extension, reuse, or rewriting of your delivery process through CUE.

No more hard-to-maintain scripts and complex bridging codes; end-users need not concern themselves with any infrastructure detailsâ€”they can focus solely on defining and deploying applications. Once orchestrated, they can run anywhere.

## OAM Compared to Other Applications

### OAM Applications vs. Native Applications

OAM applications are a modern application delivery system built on a cloud-native technology stack. They leverage the OAM model and Kubernetes as the control plane to tackle a long-standing challenge: how to make application delivery easier. Hence, OAM applications are more user-friendly and facilitate more straightforward delivery than native applications.

### OAM Applications vs. GitOps Applications

OAM applications can be based on GitOps processes and enhance capabilities across clouds and environments:

- OAM applications feature a user-friendly and programmable workflow that can integrate existing delivery tools.
- OAM applications provide cross-environment delivery capabilities, allowing descriptions of differentiated configurations across multiple clusters and unified status monitoring.

### OAM Applications vs. Template Applications

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that can provide a set of YAML files for packaging, installing, and upgrading as a unit called Chart.

As an application delivery system, OAM can deploy various types of artifacts: Kustomize, YAML, etc., including Charts. Helm can conveniently deliver Charts to a single cluster, while OAM can help you deliver Charts to multiple clusters while addressing the issue of configuration drift.
