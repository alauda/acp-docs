Introduce common issues users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is brief, place it directly on the "Troubleshooting" single page. If the content is extensive, create a table of contents for "Troubleshooting," with each issue documented separately.

You can view the corresponding document examples at [Troubleshooting Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html).

:::

# \<Title: Generally the Issue Name>

## Issue Description

Provide detailed information about the environment where the issue occurs, its scope of impact, and the symptoms of the problem. Additionally, include the following auxiliary information as appropriate:

- Problem Screenshot: It is currently recommended to primarily use text descriptions. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used, and users need to register with the documentation team for discussion.
- Related Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have occurred which led to this issue (could be a single definitive cause or various possible causes). For each cause, the following conditions should be met:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and has been confirmed to lead to the issue, not hypothesized or imagined reasons.
2. A detailed causal analysis must be provided, including:
   - How this cause triggers the issue.
   - The specific mechanism and process of the issue occurring.

## Troubleshooting (Optional)

List the specific steps for troubleshooting the issue in detail. Through troubleshooting, users can select the most likely or certain cause among multiple reasons and use appropriate solutions to resolve the issue. Note the following for troubleshooting:

- If there is only one root cause, provide troubleshooting steps and it is recommended to present them in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes and the troubleshooting steps differ, use a third-level heading format to list each root cause, and provide detailed troubleshooting steps under each root cause.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level heading should be "Solution")

Specific cautions, prerequisites, and operational steps for resolving the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level heading should be "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes with different corresponding solutions, each solution should have its own second-level heading, named "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," etc.

### Precautions (Optional)

Cautions to note before beginning the operation. Failure to read this carefully may result in operational failures or even more severe consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that need to be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level heading can be omitted if there are no precautions or prerequisites)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list format; if the steps are complex, additional headings can be used to differentiate between them. In this case, a fourth-level heading format can be used to list each step, with specific steps presented in ordered list format under each step.
- If operations are performed on a container platform, a detailed step-by-step operation list can be provided; if the operations are on a third-party platform or other software, only the key steps should be mentioned.

  > Reason: Non-container platform operations, if written too detailed, may lead to difficulties in updating the documentation promptly when their interfaces change, potentially causing numerous issues. To ensure the long-term usability of the documentation, operational steps for third-party platforms should adhere to the following principles:
  >
  > - Highlight core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid excessive reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic process of operations.

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level heading should be removed)

This section should have content identical to the Solution for Root Cause 1 format and will not be reiterated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures (suggestions, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.) to prevent the recurrence of this issue.

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can include some content used in the document but is not suitable for placement in the main text, such as usage methods and reference materials.
