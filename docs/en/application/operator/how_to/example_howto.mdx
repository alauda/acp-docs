1. Overview

The HowTo document is a practice-oriented technical document focused on addressing specific problems in concrete scenarios. It combines product features with practical applications to provide users with comprehensive solution guidance.

2. Document Characteristics

HowTo documents have the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-Oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios.
- High Practicality: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a certain goal," emphasizing practical operation guidance.
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
- Replicability: Users can follow the document steps to replicate the solution in similar scenarios.

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify the specific needs and pain points of users.
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution.
- Assess the implementation conditions and possible limitations.

Audience Targeting

- Identify the target readers (e.g., developers, ops personnel, system administrators, etc.).
- Evaluate the technical background and knowledge level of the readers.
- Understand the work scenarios and environments of the readers.
