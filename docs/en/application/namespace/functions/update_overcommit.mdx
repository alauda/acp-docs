# Update Oversubscription Ratio

Update the oversubscription ratio for the created namespace. You can refer to the resource demands for CPU and memory within the current namespace to individually set the oversubscription ratio for the namespace, thus limiting the container CPU and memory limit (limits) and request (requests) values set by users within the namespace to a reasonable range to enhance the utilization of computing resources.

- **Oversubscription Ratio**: The ratio of limit values to request values (limits/requests).

- **Limit Values (limits)**: The maximum amount of resources that a container can use at runtime. The resource usage during the container's operation must not exceed this value.

- **Request Values (requests)**: The amount of resources a container requests upon creation. Kubernetes will use this value to determine the scheduling of containers and will place the container on nodes where the available resources meet the container's request values. If no nodes satisfy the requirements (e.g., when the request values exceed the available resources of the schedulable nodes), the container will not start normally.

## Precautions

In clusters with node virtualization enabled, if you need to configure the virtual machine oversubscription ratio, you must first disable the oversubscription ratio of the cluster or namespace.

## Operation Steps

1. Enter the **Project Management** view.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Namespaces** > **Namespaces**.

3. Click on the ***namespace name*** to be updated.

4. Click on **Actions** in the upper right corner > **Update Oversubscription Ratio**.

5. Select the appropriate oversubscription ratio **configuration method** to set the CPU or memory oversubscription ratio for the namespace.

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inherit from Cluster** | <ul><li>The oversubscription ratio of the namespace defaults to **inherit from the cluster**, the **value** displays the oversubscription ratio settings of the originating cluster. For example, if the CPU and memory oversubscription ratios of the cluster are both set to 4, then the CPU and memory oversubscription ratios of the current namespace default to 4.</li><br /><li>When creating an application, the container's request value is fixed at **specified limit value/cluster oversubscription ratio**. If no limit value is specified, the limit value is set to the **default value** in the container quota of the namespace.</li><br /><li>Example: Assume the CPU resource oversubscription ratio of the cluster is set to 4, and the namespace oversubscription ratio inherits from the cluster. When a user creates an application and specifies a CPU limit value of 4c, the CPU request value will be 4c/4 = 1c.</li></ul>                                                                        |
| **Custom**   | <ul><li>The namespace oversubscription ratio **value** is determined by the administrator's custom settings, only supporting positive integers greater than 1; if left blank, it indicates that the current namespace has no oversubscription ratio.<br />For example, if the CPU and memory oversubscription ratios of the cluster are both set to 4, and custom values here are both set to 2, then the CPU and memory oversubscription ratios of the current namespace are both 2; if no custom values are provided here, it indicates that the CPU and memory of the current namespace have no oversubscription ratio set.</li><br /><li>When creating an application, the container's request value is fixed at **specified limit value/namespace oversubscription ratio**. If no limit value is specified, the limit value is set to the **default value** in the container quota of the namespace.</li><br /><li>Example: Assume the CPU resource oversubscription ratio of the cluster is set to 4, and the namespace oversubscription ratio is customized to 2. When a user creates an application specifying a CPU limit value of 4c, the CPU request value will be 4c/2 = 2c.</li></ul> |

5. Click **Update**.

**Note**: Updating the oversubscription ratio value does not affect the request values of containers that are already running applications; after a Pod is rebuilt, the container's request values will be recalculated according to the latest oversubscription ratio.
