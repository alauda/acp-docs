1. Overview

The HowTo document is a practice-oriented technical document that focuses on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. It combines product features with practical applications to provide users with comprehensive solution guidance.

2. Document Features

The HowTo document has the following core features:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios
- Highly practical: Directly answers the question "how to achieve a certain goal," emphasizing practical operation guidance
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation
- Reproducibility: Users can follow the steps in the document to reproduce the solution in similar scenarios

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify users' specific needs and pain points
- Determine the applicability of the solution
- Assess implementation conditions and potential constraints

Audience Positioning

- Identify target readers (such as developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.)
- Assess readers' technical background and knowledge level
- Understand readers' working scenarios and environments

# \<HowTo Title: Starts with a General Verb\>

> Function name; if the goal is very clear, it is recommended to specify the task objective, using a verb at the beginning, e.g., Connect to Cluster/Upgrade Cluster.

## Function Overview

> There is no fixed introduction pattern, but it can be considered from aspects such as what it is, usage scenarios, and usage purpose.

## Usage Scenarios

> Consider the function (what it is, usage scenarios, usage purpose, etc.)

## Prerequisites

> Specify the preparations or necessary conditions before formally using this function. An ordered list is recommended.

Before using the function, ensure:

- Condition 1
- Condition 2
- ......

## Operation Steps

> Provide specific operation steps for using the function. If necessary, provide “tips,” “notes,” or “warnings” under relevant steps.

Use the function by following these steps:

1. Step 1

> For the description of the steps, it is recommended to adopt clear executable steps, such as: Scale the number of replicas in the Deployment to 3, rather than using overly vague statements: Increase the number of instances.

2. Step 2
3. ......

Parameter descriptions are as follows:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ |
|        |        |
|        |        |
|        |        |

## Operation Results

> Describe how to verify whether the task has been successfully completed. If the title is already sufficiently directive, this section can be removed.

## Learn More

> If there are many extensions of this scenario or function, other information related to the task can be provided here for the user.

## Subsequent Actions

> If applicable, specify subsequent tasks after completing this task and hyperlink to relevant documents.
