Introduce common issues users may encounter and their resolutions. If the content is brief, place it directly in the "Troubleshooting" single page; if the content is extensive, use "Troubleshooting" as a directory, with each issue as a separate document.

You can refer to the [Troubleshooting Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) for a corresponding document sample.

:::

# \<Title: Generally the issue name>

## Problem Description

Provide detailed information about the environment in which the problem occurs, its scope of impact, and the symptoms, while adding the following auxiliary information where appropriate:

- Problem screenshots: Currently, it is recommended to use textual descriptions first. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used. Users need to register and discuss this with the documentation team.
- Related logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in the form of code blocks.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have been confirmed to lead to this problem (it can be a single definite cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause needs to meet the following conditions:

1. It must be a confirmed actual cause that has occurred and is proven to lead to the problem, rather than a speculative or hypothetical cause.
2. Provide a detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How this cause triggers the problem.
   - The specific mechanism and process through which the problem occurs.

## Problem Troubleshooting (Optional)

List the specific steps for troubleshooting the issue in detail. Through troubleshooting, users can identify the most likely or certain cause from multiple potential causes and apply appropriate resolutions. When troubleshooting, please note:

- If there is only one root cause, troubleshooting steps should be provided, preferably presented in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different troubleshooting steps, use a tertiary heading format to list each root cause, and provide detailed troubleshooting steps under each cause.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is only one root cause, this second-level heading should simply be "Solution")

Provide specific considerations, prerequisites, and operational steps to resolve this issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level heading should be "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes and each has a different resolution, each solution should be presented under a separate second-level heading such as "Solution for Root Cause 1", "Solution for Root Cause N", etc.

### Considerations (Optional)

Important points to consider before starting operations. Failing to read this carefully may result in operational failure or even more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that must be met before starting operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This tertiary heading can be omitted if there are no considerations or prerequisites)

- Operational steps should generally be presented in an ordered list format; if the steps are complex, additional headings can be used to differentiate them. In this case, quarto-level headings can be used to list each step, with specific steps outlined in ordered lists below each step.
- If operations are performed in a container platform, detail every operational step; if conducted on third-party platforms or other software, only the corresponding key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if written too detailed, we cannot ensure timely updates to the document when its interface changes, potentially leading to many issues. To ensure the document's long-term usability, descriptions of operational steps on third-party platforms should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Focus on core steps and key actions.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain the generality and flexibility of operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic flow of the operations.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple root causes; this second-level heading should be removed if there is only one root cause)

This section's content and form should be consistent with the Solution for Root Cause 1, and will not be elaborated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the issue from recurring (suggestions, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can contain some content used in the documentation that is not suitable for inclusion in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
