1. Overview

HowTo documents are practice-oriented technical documents that focus on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. They combine product features with real-world application cases, providing users with comprehensive solution guidance.

2. Document Characteristics

HowTo documents have the following core features:

- Scenario-oriented: Offers end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios
- Highly practical: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a specific goal," emphasizing practical operational guidance
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to the implementation of solutions
- Replicability: Users can replicate solutions in similar scenarios by following the steps in the document

3. Writing Preparation

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements must be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify users' specific needs and pain points
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution
- Assess implementation conditions and potential limitations

Audience Targeting

- Identify the target readers (e.g., developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.)
- Evaluate the technical background and knowledge level of the readers
- Understand the working scenarios and environments of the readers
