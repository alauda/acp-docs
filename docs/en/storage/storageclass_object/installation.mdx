If the module needs to be deployed separately, deployment documentation must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The deployment documentation should include deployment procedures, deployment configurations, uninstallation processes, etc. If the deployment documentation is extensive, it can be transformed into a directory and split into multiple documents for introduction within the directory.

You can visit [Deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding documentation.
