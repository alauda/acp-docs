:::tip

If the parent module requires a separate manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, and so on.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be structured as a directory, which provides upgrade documents for different versions (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can access [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view examples of the corresponding documents.
