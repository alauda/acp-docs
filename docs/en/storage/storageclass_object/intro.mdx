1. What is an introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functions, target users, and expected uses, giving readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We usually decide whether to combine the introduction, advantages, and feature overview into a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products containing multiple core modules), it is advisable to break these contents into separate documents; for single functional modules, it can be combined into a single document.

2. Importance of the introduction

There may be many points involved in a product or functional module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified understanding: It can provide a consistent understanding at the outset, reducing communication errors.
- Guide reading: It offers a clear product background for readers, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Improve efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repeated explanations regarding the fundamental understanding of the product.

3. How to structure the introduction section

- Concise and clear: Summarize the core points of the product using simple language, avoiding lengthy descriptions.
- Highlight key points: Emphasize the product’s unique selling points and main functions.
- Audience-focused: Consider the background of the target audience, providing information that concerns them.

4. The uniqueness of the introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for functional module descriptions in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better communicate the value of product functions, enabling users to quickly understand and use the product features.

We will find some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of product-level introductions

- **Product positioning:** Clearly state the product’s position in the industry and competitive advantages.
- **Complete ecosystem:** Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable scenarios:** The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive, and must be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of module-level introductions

- **Module positioning:** Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module characteristics:** Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable scenarios:** Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Except for the introduction section itself, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This is a brief description. Specifically introduces what the expected purpose of \<Product/Module Name> is. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module aimed at cloud-native applications, built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling the underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management across multi-cloud and multi-clusters, significantly simplifying the application cloud migration process for enterprises, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-grade container cloud management platform.
