:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Any "concepts" introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concept" is relatively simple and does not require a separate documentation introduction, a brief explanation can be provided within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory for a more comprehensive introduction.

You can view an example document at the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html).

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality. The diagrams can contain the following elements:

- Core components: Such as Operators, Tasks, Middleware, etc., illustrating the connections and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data flow: For example, the resources introduced, the dependencies between resources, and the process of how resources are consumed.
- Deployment architecture: For example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description under the architecture diagram to explain the meaning of the image and the roles of each part within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a specific concept requires further explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts."
