:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Concepts introduced in the architecture are recommended to link to the corresponding chapters in the "Core Concepts" section below. If the introduced concept is relatively simple and does not require a separate document for explanation, a brief explanation can be provided in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to provide a detailed introduction.

You can access the [architecture document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view sample documents.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality, which can contain the following content:

- Core Components: such as Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., depicting the relationships and functions of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: such as the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption.
- Deployment Architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description of the image below the architecture diagram, explaining the meaning of the image and the functions of its various parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding chapter in the "Core Concepts".
