# Architecture

## Technical architecture

![](./assets/rook_ceph_architecture.png)

Example applications are shown above for the three supported storage types:

- Block Storage is represented with a blue app, which has a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) volume mounted. The application can read and write to the RWO volume, while Ceph manages the IO.
- Shared Filesystem is represented by two purple apps that are sharing a ReadWriteMany (RWX) volume. Both applications can actively read or write simultaneously to the volume. Ceph will ensure the data is safely protected for multiple writers with the MDS daemon.
- Object storage is represented by an orange app that can read and write to a bucket with a standard S3 client.

Below the dotted line in the above diagram, the components fall into three categories:

- [Rook operator](./concepts/concept.mdx#rook-operator) (blue layer): The operator automates configuration of Ceph
- [CSI plugins and provisioners](./concepts/concept.mdx#ceph-csi) (orange layer): The Ceph-CSI driver provides the provisioning and mounting of volumes
- [Ceph daemons](./concepts/concept.mdx#ceph-module-functions) (red layer): The Ceph daemons run the core storage architecture. See the Glossary to learn more about each daemon.

**Block Storage**  
In the diagram above, the flow to create an application with an RWO volume is:

- The (blue) app creates a PVC to request storage.
- The PVC defines the Ceph RBD storage class (sc) for provisioning the storage.
- K8s calls the Ceph-CSI RBD provisioner to create the Ceph RBD image.
- The kubelet calls the CSI RBD volume plugin to mount the volume in the app.
- The volume is now available for reads and writes.
- A ReadWriteOnce volume can be mounted on one node at a time.

**Shared Filesystem**  
In the diagram above, the flow to create a applications with a RWX volume is:

- The (purple) app creates a PVC to request storage.
- The PVC defines the CephFS storage class (sc) for provisioning the storage.
- K8s calls the Ceph-CSI CephFS provisioner to create the CephFS subvolume.
- The kubelet calls the CSI CephFS volume plugin to mount the volume in the app.
- The volume is now available for reads and writes.
- A ReadWriteMany volume can be mounted on multiple nodes for your application to use.

**Object Storage S3**  
In the diagram above, the flow to create an application with access to an S3 bucket is:
- The (orange) app creates an BucketClaim to request a bucket.
- The Ceph COSI Driver creates a Ceph RGW bucket.
- The Ceph COSI Driver creates a secret with the credentials for accessing the bucket.
- The app retrieves the credentials from the secret.
- The app can now read and write to the bucket with an S3 client.
