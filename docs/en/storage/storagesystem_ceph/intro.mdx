# Introduction

**Alauda Container Platform (ACP) Storage with Ceph** is a hyper-converged storage solution provided by the platform within the cluster. Based on the open-source Rook + Ceph storage solution, distributed storage achieves automatic management, automatic scaling, and automatic repair capabilities, fulfilling the block storage, file storage, and object storage needs of small to medium-sized applications.

:::note
In this document, **distributed storage** refers to the Ceph storage within this cluster, while **external storage** refers to Ceph storage outside of this cluster.

## Feature Overview

- **Easy Deployment**: Provides graphical automatic deployment and management services for storage clusters; supports both integrated and decoupled deployment modes for compute and storage.

- **Professional Operations**: Offers persistent volume snapshot backup and clone new volume functionalities; visual monitoring of capacity, performance, and component levels; equipped with built-in alert policies to meet the needs of most storage operation scenarios.

- **Secure and Reliable**: Distributed and multi-replica mechanisms ensure data security and reliability; simple and reliable automated management supports online expansion of storage resources.

- **Excellent Performance**: Provides elastic and high-performance storage services; supports the deployment of hybrid disk devices to enhance storage system performance and efficiency.

## Storage Solution Comparison

The platform supports the following two types of storage solutions; you can choose one or the other.

### Creating a Storage Cluster

| Requirement                              | Advantages                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **You can choose to create either a [standard type cluster](./installation/create_service_stand.mdx) or an [extended type cluster](./installation/create_service_extend.mdx)** | No need for additional storage solution preparation; configuration can be completed on the business cluster, saving costs. |

### [Accessing External Storage](./functions/access_storage_service.mdx)

Option 1: Access the distributed storage resources of other business clusters within the platform to ensure storage and business are isolated for easier management and maintenance.

Option 2: Integrate external Ceph storage resources as distributed storage.

| Requirement (choose one)                       | Advantages                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Option 1: Distributed storage already deployed in other business clusters.** | Can fully utilize storage resources across clusters and avoid interference from business changes. Ensures data security and stability while reducing operational complexity.<br /><br /> **Note**: If the storage to be accessed is distributed storage from different platforms, such as a primary/backup platform in a disaster recovery environment, please use the method of integrating external Ceph. |
| **Option 2: External Ceph storage outside the platform, version ≥ 14.2.3.** | Compared to directly creating a storage class, this method is more convenient for using the platform’s interface for volume snapshots, scaling, and other functions. |

**Note**: If you need to maintain the storage pool, storage device, and other configurations of external storage, operations must be performed in the management interface of the storage cluster.
