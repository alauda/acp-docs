Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be integrated into a single document to introduce multiple concepts. Conversely, it is recommended to have a separate document for each concept. For obscure and complex concepts, it is suggested to write a standalone article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to introduce the concepts in a more accessible manner.

You can access the [concept document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to view examples of corresponding documents.
