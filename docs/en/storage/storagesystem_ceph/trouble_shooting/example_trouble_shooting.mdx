Introduce common problems and solutions that users may encounter. If the content is limited, it can be placed directly on a single page named "Problem Handling". If there is more content, "Problem Handling" can serve as a directory, with each problem being a separate document.

You can access the [Problem Handling Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) for a sample of the corresponding document.

:::

# \<Title: Generally the Name of the Problem>

## Problem Description

Provide a detailed description of the environment in which the problem occurs, its impact, the symptoms of the issue, and appropriately add the following auxiliary information:

- Problem Screenshot: Currently, it is recommended to use textual descriptions first. If the text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used, and the user needs to register and discuss them with the documentation team.
- Related Logs: Present error messages, system logs, debug information, etc., in code blocks.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this problem (these can be a single definite cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause must meet the following criteria:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and has been verified to lead to this problem, not a speculated or imagined cause.
2. Detailed causal analysis must be provided, including:
   - How this cause triggers the problem.
   - The specific mechanism and process through which the problem occurs.

## Problem Troubleshooting (Optional)

List the specific steps to troubleshoot the problem. Through troubleshooting, users can identify the most likely or certain cause among multiple reasons and apply suitable solutions. When troubleshooting, keep in mind:

- If there is only one root cause, provide troubleshooting steps. It is recommended to present them in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes and the troubleshooting steps are different, use a tertiary heading format to list each root cause, providing detailed troubleshooting steps under each.

  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution to Root Cause 1 (This is the heading style for multiple root causes. If there is a single root cause, this secondary heading should be “Solution”.)

Specify the details regarding the precautions, preconditions, and operational steps to resolve the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the secondary heading should be “Solution”; if there are multiple root causes with different solutions, each should be titled separately, e.g., “Solution to Root Cause 1”, “Solution to Root Cause N”, etc.

### Precautions (Optional)

Precautions that need to be considered before starting the operations. Failing to carefully read this section may lead to operation failures or even more severe consequences.

### Preconditions (Optional)

Conditions that must be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (Can be omitted if there are no precautions or preconditions)

- Operational steps are generally displayed in an ordered list format. If the steps are complicated, additional headings may be added to distinguish between steps, which can be listed in a fourth-level heading format, with specific steps presented as ordered lists.
- If operations are conducted on a container platform, detailed steps for each operation should be presented. If operations are executed on third-party platforms or other software, only the key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if too detailed, we cannot guarantee timely updates to the document when interface changes occur, potentially leading to many issues. To ensure the long-term usability of the document, descriptions of third-party platform operational steps should adhere to the following principles:
  >
  > - Highlight core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain the generality and flexibility of operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose of the operation and the basic process.

...

## Solution to Root Cause N (This is the heading style for multiple root causes; if there is only one root cause, this secondary heading should be removed)

This section should follow the same format as the solution for Root Cause 1, and will not be restated.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures (suggestions, commands, operations, conditions, etc.) to prevent the problem from occurring again.

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can contain content that is used in the document but is inconvenient to include in the main text, such as usage methods for tools, reference materials, etc.
