:::tip

If the parent module requires manual upgrade operations separately, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade process between different versions, the upgrade document should be converted into a directory, and different versions' upgrade documents should be provided within that directory (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view examples of the corresponding documentation.
