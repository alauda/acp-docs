# Component Fixed Deployment

After creating distributed storage, you can still view and modify the deployment location of components, facilitating storage expansion and maintenance.

## Update Component Deployment Configuration

### Precautions

- Updating the configuration will trigger the system to automatically rebuild component instances, which may affect service access to the storage system. It is recommended to perform the update during off-peak hours.

- When the cluster type is **Extend**, the fixed deployment feature for components is not supported.

### Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Storage Management** > **Distributed Storage**.

3. Under the **Storage Components** tab, click on **Component Deployment Configuration**.

4. Enable/disable the **Fixed Deployment** switch according to business needs, and deploy components to specified nodes. The number of nodes must be no less than three to ensure minimum availability. The components applicable for fixed deployment configuration include MON, MGR, MDS, RGW.

5. Click **Update**, and the components will begin to be scheduled to the designated nodes.

## Restart Storage Components

When you delete the deployed storage components, the system will automatically re-schedule and redeploy components to the nodes according to the current component deployment strategy.

### Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click on **Storage Management** > **Distributed Storage**.

3. Under the **Storage Components** tab, click â‹® next to the component name > **Delete**.
