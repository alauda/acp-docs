# Adding Devices/Device Classes

## Adding Device Classes

Unify the classification of devices of the same type or hard disks with the same business logic in cluster nodes, customize device classes according to storage needs, and allocate different storage contents to different types of storage disks.

### Notes

Adding device classes is not supported when the cluster type is **Extend**.

### Procedure

<Steps>

1. Enter **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Distributed Storage**.

3. Click the **Device Classes** tab.

4. Click **Add Device Class** and configure the relevant parameters according to the following instructions.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                  |
   | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Name**       | The name of the device class. The following names cannot be used for the device class: `hdd`, `ssd`, `nvme`.                                        |
   | **Storage Devices** | Select **Blank Disks** or **Unformatted Disk Partitions** in the node. <ul><li>When the switch for all empty devices is turned on: add all empty devices under the node to this device class;</li><li>When the switch for all empty devices is turned off: manually enter the names of the empty devices under the node, for example, `sda`.</li></ul> |

</Steps>

## Adding Devices

Map available hard disks to storage devices for usage and management.

**Note**: Once hard disks are added as storage devices, updating or removing them through the interface is not supported.

### Procedure

<Steps>

1. Enter **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Distributed Storage**.

3. Click the **Device Classes** tab.

4. On the right side of the device class, click **Add Device**, and configure the relevant parameters according to the following instructions.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                        |
   | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Node Type**   | Select the type of node where the hard disk you want to add as a storage device is located. <br />**Compute Node**: A node that has not added storage devices. <br />**Storage Node**: A node that has added storage devices. |
   | **Add Type**    | Select the method to add hard disks as storage devices. <br />**All Empty Disks**: Choose to add all unpartitioned mounted disks in the node as storage devices. <br />**Specified Disks**: Choose to add some disks in the node as storage devices, including empty disks or already partitioned mounted disks. <br />When the node type is **Storage Node**, only **Specified Disks** can be selected. |
   | **Specified Disks** | When the add type is **Specified Disks**, enter the names of all the hard disks to be added as storage devices, such as `sda`, `sdb`. After entering each hard disk name, press Enter to confirm. <br /><br /><b>Note</b>: It is recommended to use the entire hard disk as storage devices rather than partitions on the hard disk. |

5. Click **Add**.

</Steps>

## Hard Disk Status

- **Normal**: The corresponding status of the storage device is IN+UP.

- **Abnormal**: The corresponding status of the storage device is IN+DOWN.

- **Offline**: The corresponding status of the storage device is OUT+UP.

- **Fault**: The corresponding status of the storage device is OUT+DOWN.
