# Adding Devices/Device Classes

## Adding Device Classes

Unify the classification of devices of the same type or hard disks with the same business logic in cluster nodes, customize device classes according to storage needs, and allocate different storage contents to different types of storage disks.

### Notes

Adding device classes is not supported when the cluster type is **Extend**.

### Procedure

<Steps>

1. Enter **Administrator**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Distributed Storage**.

3. Click the **Device Classes** tab.

4. Click **Add Device Class** and configure the relevant parameters according to the following instructions.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                 |
   | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Name**       | The name of the device class. The following names cannot be used for the device class: `hdd`, `ssd`, `nvme`.                                        |
   | **Storage Devices** | To add storage devices to a device class, you can choose between the `Selection Device` and `Input Device` methods: <ul><li>**Selection Device**: <br></br>Select from available storage devices. A device is considered available if it meets the following criteria: <ul><li>Device type is either disk or mpath</li></ul><ul><li>No file system is detected (fsType is blank)</li></ul><ul><li>Capacity exceeds 10 GiB</li></ul>Devices such as rbd, nbd, and dm-* will not be displayed in the list of available selectable devices.<br></br><br></br>**Note**: Requires prior deployment of the Alauda Build of LocalStorage Operator.</li></ul> <ul><li>**Input Device**: <br></br>Manually input the names of the blank devices under the node, such as `sda`.<br></br><br></br>**Note**: For optimal performance and management, it is strongly advised to utilize raw disk as storage devices instead of employing individual partitions on a disk.</li></ul>|

</Steps>

## Adding Devices

Map available hard disks to storage devices for usage and management.

**Note**: Once hard disks are added as storage devices, updating or removing them through the interface is not supported.

### Procedure

<Steps>

1. Enter **Administrator**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Distributed Storage**.

3. Click the **Device Classes** tab.

4. On the right side of the device class, click **Add Device**, and configure the relevant parameters according to the following instructions.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                 |
   | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Specified Disks** | To add storage devices to a device class, you can choose between the `Selection Device` and `Input Device` methods: <ul><li>**Selection Device**: <br></br>Select from available storage devices. A device is considered available if it meets the following criteria: <ul><li>Device type is either disk or mpath</li></ul><ul><li>No file system is detected (fsType is blank)</li></ul><ul><li>Capacity exceeds 10 GiB</li></ul>Devices such as rbd, nbd, and dm-* will not be displayed in the list of available selectable devices.<br></br><br></br>**Note**: Requires prior deployment of the Alauda Build of LocalStorage Operator.</li></ul> <ul><li>**Input Device**: <br></br>Manually input the names of the blank devices under the node, such as `sda`.<br></br><br></br>**Note**: For optimal performance and management, it is strongly advised to utilize raw disks as storage devices instead of employing individual partitions on a disk.</li></ul>|

5. Click **Add**.

</Steps>

## Hard Disk Status

- **Normal**: The corresponding status of the storage device is IN+UP.

- **Abnormal**: The corresponding status of the storage device is IN+DOWN.

- **Offline**: The corresponding status of the storage device is OUT+UP.

- **Fault**: The corresponding status of the storage device is OUT+DOWN.
