# Managing Storage Pools

A storage pool refers to a logical partition used for storing data. A single storage cluster supports the simultaneous use of different types of storage pools, such as file storage and block storage, to accommodate various business requirements.

## Creating a Storage Pool

In addition to the storage pools created during the configuration of distributed storage, you can also create additional types of storage pools.

**Tip**: Within the same storage cluster, only one file storage and one object storage pool are allowed, while up to eight block storage pools can be created.

### Steps to Operate

1. Access **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Distributed Storage**.

3. In the **Cluster Information** tab, scroll down to the **Storage Pool** area and click **Create Storage Pool**.

4. Configure the relevant parameters according to the following instructions.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
   | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Storage Type** | Select the currently undeployed storage type.<br />- File Storage: Provides secure, reliable, and scalable shared file storage services. Suitable for file sharing, data backup, etc.<br />- Block Storage: Provides high IOPS and low latency storage services. Suitable for databases, virtualization, etc.<br />- Object Storage: Provides standard S3 interface storage services, suitable for big data, backup archiving, cloud storage services, etc.    |
   | **Replica Count** | <ul><li>**When the cluster type is Standard**: A higher replica count increases redundancy and data security, but it also reduces storage utilization. Usually, a setting of 3 suffices for most needs.</li><li>**When the cluster type is Extended**: The default replica count is 4 and cannot be modified.</li></ul>                     |
   | **Device Class**  | <ul><li>**When the cluster type is Standard**: Choose an already added device class within the created storage pool.<ul><li>When selecting a device class, data will be stored in the chosen device class.</li><li>If no device class is selected, data will be randomly stored in all devices within the storage pool.</li></ul></li><li>**When the cluster type is Standard**: Adding a device class is not supported.</li></ul> |

   If it is an object storage type, you can configure the following parameters as well:

   | Parameter       | Description                                   |
   | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
   | **Region**   | Specify the region where the storage pool is located.         |
   | **Gateway Type** | Defaults to S3 and cannot be modified.         |
   | **Internal Port** | Specify the port for internal access to the cluster.         |
   | **External Access** | Enabling/disabling external access will create/destroy a NodePort type Service. |
   | **Instance Count** | Number of resource instances for object storage.             |

5. Click **Create**.

## Deleting a Storage Pool

If a certain type of storage is no longer required, the storage pool can be deleted after dissociating it from the storage class.

### Steps to Operate

1. Access **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Distributed Storage**.

3. In the **Cluster Information** tab, scroll down to the **Storage Pool** area, click on the ⋮ next to the storage pool you wish to delete > **Delete**.

4. Read the prompt information and enter the name of the storage pool.

5. Click **Delete**.

## Viewing Object Storage Pool Addresses \{#storepool}

After creating an object storage pool, you can view the internal and external access addresses of the storage pool.

### Steps to Operate

1. Access **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Distributed Storage**.

3. In the **Cluster Information** tab, scroll down to the **Storage Pool** area, click on the ⋮ next to the object storage pool and select **View Address**.
