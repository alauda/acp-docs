# Comparison and Selection

## Storage Class Feature Comparison

### Supported Access Modes

The following table shows the differences in storage classes and their corresponding access modes provided by the platform by default. If you are using other storage classes, please refer to the [Kubernetes official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) to understand the level of access mode support for those storage classes in a Kubernetes environment.

- ReadWriteOnce (RWO): Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.

- ReadOnlyMany (ROX): Can be mounted as read-only by multiple nodes.

- ReadWriteMany (RWX): Can be mounted as read-write by multiple nodes.

| Storage Class        | ReadWriteOnce (RWO) | ReadOnlyMany (ROX) | ReadWriteMany (RWX) |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **CephFS File Storage** | Supported   | Not supported | Supported   |
| **CephRBD Block Storage** | Supported   | Not supported | Not supported |
| **TopoLVM**           | Supported   | Not supported | Not supported |
| **NFS Shared Storage** | Supported   | Not supported | Supported   |

### Supported Storage System Types

**File Storage**, also known as file-level storage or file-based storage, offers a rich and diverse set of features that can store almost any content. It is particularly suited for storing a wide range of complex files and helps users find them quickly.

**Block Storage** is an efficient and reliable method of data storage that is easy to use and manage, suitable for business applications that perform large transactions or deploy large databases.

| Storage Class        | Type          | Volume Mode              |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| **CephFS File Storage** | File Storage   | File System              |
| **CephRBD Block Storage** | Block Storage  | File System, Block Device |
| **TopoLVM**           | Block Storage  | File System, Block Device |
| **NFS Shared Storage** | File Storage   | File System              |

### Storage Features

Currently, the platform only supports creating volume snapshots for PVCs that are **dynamically created** using the storage class. You can create new PVCs based on these snapshots and bind them to those PVCs. The supported access modes when creating PVCs from snapshots differ from those supported when creating PVCs using the storage class. For reference, see [Deploy Volume Snapshot Components](/storage/pv_snapshot/functions/snapshot_con.mdx).

| Storage Class         | Volume Snapshot | Expansion |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| **CephFS File Storage** | Supported      | Supported |
| **CephRBD Block Storage** | Supported      | Supported |
| **TopoLVM**           | Supported      | Supported |
| **NFS Shared Storage** | Not Supported  | Not Supported |
