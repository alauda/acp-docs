# Introduction

## Storage Class

The StorageClass is a Kubernetes resource used to describe the categories of storage resources available in a Kubernetes cluster, making it a cluster-related resource. Administrators can configure storage classes based on the desired quality of service level and backup, security, or other policies to cater to different business scenarios.

Storage classes can also be viewed as templates for creating Persistent Volumes (PV) and storage buckets. When developers or testers create Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) or bucket claims to request storage resources, they need to select a storage class. Once the Persistent Volume Claim or bucket claim is successfully created, Kubernetes will call the API of the storage plugin to automatically and dynamically create storage volumes that comply with the Persistent Volume Claim or bucket request according to the relevant configuration, thereby saving time and labor costs in resource creation.

Furthermore, storage classes allow different types of backend storage to be associated with Persistent Volumes and storage buckets in the cluster. By setting a storage class as the default and assigning it to all projects under the cluster or a specific project, it facilitates ordinary users in selecting the associated class.
