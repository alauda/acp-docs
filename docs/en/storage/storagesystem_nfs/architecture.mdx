:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

It is recommended to link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" for any "concepts" introduced in the architecture. If the introduced "concepts" are simple and do not require a separate document for explanation, they can be briefly described in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory to provide a clearer introduction.

You can refer to the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to see an example document.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to the function, which may contain the following content:

- Core Components: Such as Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., and illustrate the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: Such as introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: Such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram to explain its significance and the role of each part within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts."
