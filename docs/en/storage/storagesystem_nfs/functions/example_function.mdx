When writing functional documentation, the person responsible for each feature should reasonably split the documentation pages and directory structure according to the characteristics of the specific feature. Priority should be given to providing the corresponding CLI operation instructions to help users get started quickly.

1. Overview

Functional guide documentation is usually located between the feature overview and HowTo documents, focusing on a detailed introduction of a single feature. It can cover a detailed description of the feature itself.

2. Core Characteristics

The functional guide documentation should have the following core characteristics:

- Concept-oriented: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the feature.
- Flexibility: Describe the feature without relying on specific scenarios.
- Detailed CLI explanation: Prioritize providing detailed command-line operation instructions to help users quickly achieve functionality through the CLI. Then, supplement the usage of the feature interface corresponding to this functionality.

3. Differences Between Functional Documents and HowTo Documents

Functional documents often accompany some introductions to feature usage and operations, but the distinction between them and HowTo can often confuse us. Their differences are:

- **Content Focus**
  - Functional Guide: Answers "what it is" and "why," helping users understand the feature itself.
  - HowTo: Answers "how to do it," guiding users to complete specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Functional Guide: A systematic, hierarchical knowledge system that emphasizes concept explanation and principle explication.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear operational steps that focus on practical guidance.

- **Usage Scenarios**
  - Functional Guide: When users are initially understanding a feature or need to gain an in-depth understanding of the feature's principles.
  - HowTo: When users need to resolve specific issues or complete specific tasks.

- **Coverage Scope**
  - Functional Guide: A comprehensive introduction to all features, configuration items, and usage methods of the functionality.
  - HowTo: Specific operation guides for a single scenario or task.

4. Writing Guidelines

When drafting functional documentation, especially in the CLI sections, it is recommended to follow these steps:

- Clearly define the target user group: Identify the intended audience of the documentation and their needs. Understand their familiarity with the CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content.
- Structure the content: Divide the documentation into multiple parts, such as feature introduction, detailed CLI command parameters, usage examples, and notes. Ensure that each part is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed command explanation: For each CLI command, provide detailed parameter descriptions and usage examples. Explain the command's function, applicable scenarios, and possible output results.
