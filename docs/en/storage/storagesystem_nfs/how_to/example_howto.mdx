1. Overview

HowTo documents are practical technical documents focused on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. They combine product features with real-world application contexts to provide users with comprehensive guidance on solutions.

2. Document Characteristics

HowTo documents have the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-driven: Based on specific user scenarios, providing end-to-end solutions.
- Highly practical: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a specific goal," emphasizing practical operation guidance.
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
- Replicability: Users can follow the steps in the document to reproduce the solution in similar scenarios.

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify the specific needs and pain points of users.
- Determine the applicable range of the solution.
- Assess implementation conditions and possible limitations.

Audience Targeting

- Identify the target readers (e.g., developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.).
- Assess the technical background and knowledge level of the readers.
- Understand the readers' work scenarios and environments.

# \<HowTo Title: General Verb at the Beginning>

> Feature Name: If the purpose is strong, it is recommended to clarify the task goal, and it is suggested to use a verb at the beginning, such as: Connect to Cluster / Upgrade Cluster.

## Feature Introduction

> There is no fixed introduction template, but you can think about the functionality from aspects like what it is, usage scenarios, and intended purposes.

## Usage Scenarios

> Consider what this functionality is (what it is, usage scenarios, intended purposes, etc.).

## Preconditions

> Describe the preparatory work or necessary conditions before officially using the feature. It is recommended to use a numbered list.

Before using the functionality, ensure the following:

- Condition 1
- Condition 2
- ......

## Operation Steps

> Provide specific operational steps for using the feature. If necessary, provide "Tip," "Note," or "Warning" information under related steps.

Follow these steps to use the feature:

1. Step 1

> For the description of the steps, it is advisable to provide clear executable steps, such as: Scale the number of replicas of the deployment to 3, rather than using overly vague expressions like: Increase the number of instances.

2. Step 2
3. ......

The parameter description is as follows:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
| ------ | ------ |
|        |        |
|        |        |
|        |        |

## Operation Results

> Explain how to verify whether the task has been successfully completed. If the title is sufficiently directional, this part can be deleted.

## Learn More

> If there are many extensions related to this scenario or feature usage, provide users with additional information related to the task here.

## Follow-up Actions

> If any, describe the follow-up tasks after completing the task, and hyperlink to relevant documents.
