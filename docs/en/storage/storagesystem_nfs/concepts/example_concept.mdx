Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). 
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be merged into a single document for introducing multiple concepts. Conversely, it is recommended to dedicate a separate document for each concept if they are more complex. 
For obscure or complicated concepts, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "Deep Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for an in-depth and accessible introduction. 

You can visit [Concept Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) for examples of corresponding documents.
