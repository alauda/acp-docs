1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functions, target users, and expected uses, giving readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We generally decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and overview of features in the same document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that contain multiple core modules), it is recommended to split these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be combined in the same document.

2. Importance of Introduction

There may be many points involved in a product or functional module; adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Establish Unified Understanding: It can serve as a starting point providing a consistent cognition, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Provide readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Increase Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repetitive explanations regarding the product's foundational knowledge.

3. How to Construct the Introduction Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using simple language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functionalities of the product.
- Audience-Oriented: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information relevant to their concerns.

4. Special Features of Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules within documents. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the value of product functionalities, allowing users to quickly understand and use the product features.

We will find some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introduction

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product will be more comprehensive and should be described in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introduction

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.
