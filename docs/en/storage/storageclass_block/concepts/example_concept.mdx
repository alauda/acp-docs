Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional module (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). 
If the core concepts are relatively simple, you can consolidate them into a single document to introduce multiple concepts; conversely, it is recommended to provide a separate document for each concept. 
For obscure or complex concepts, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "Understanding XXXX" in the current directory for a more in-depth and accessible explanation.
