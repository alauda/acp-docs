Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify users' specific needs and pain points
- Determine the applicability of the solution
- Assess implementation conditions and possible limitations

Audience Positioning

- Identify the target readers (e.g., developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.)
- Assess the readers' technical background and knowledge level
- Understand readers' working scenarios and environments
