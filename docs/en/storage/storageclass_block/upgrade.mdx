:::tip

If the parent module requires manual upgrade operations, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, configuration settings, rollback procedures, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory, providing different upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can access the [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) page for examples of the corresponding documents.
