1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing a general description of the product or functionality. It covers core concepts, main features, target users, and expected uses, giving readers a clear preliminary understanding.

Typically, we decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and functionality overview sections in one document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (e.g., platform products containing multiple core modules), it is advisable to separate these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. The Importance of the Introduction

The points involved in a product or functional module may be numerous, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Facilitate Unified Understanding: It can provide a consistent conception at the outset, reducing communication errors.
- Guide the Reading: It offers readers a clear product background to facilitate a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: It reduces the time needed for repeated explanations regarding the foundational understanding of the product.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Be Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product in straightforward language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the product's unique selling propositions and main features.
- Address the Audience: Consider the background of the target audience and provide the information they care about.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for the description of functional modules. Through structured content organization and clear expressions, it helps the team better communicate the product's functional value, allowing users to quickly understand and utilize the product features.

We may find some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position and competitive advantages within the industry.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functionalities included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product are broader, requiring a combined description based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Describe the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on detailing the features and advantages of the individual module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by the individual module.
