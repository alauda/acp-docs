:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

The "Concepts" introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "Concept" is relatively simple and does not require a separate document for explanation, a brief explanation can be provided within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to provide a clearer introduction.

You can refer to the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) for a sample document.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality. The diagrams can include the following content:

- Core components: For example, Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., portraying the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data flow: For example, the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the processes in which resources are consumed.
- Deployment architecture: For example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description under the architecture diagram to explain its meaning and the roles of each part within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires a more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts."
