# Introduction

MinIO is an object storage service licensed under the Apache License v2.0. It is compatible with the Amazon S3 cloud storage service interface, making it particularly suitable for storing large volumes of unstructured data, such as images, videos, log files, backup data, and container/virtual machine images. An object file can range in size from a few KB to a maximum of 5T.

**The main advantages are as follows:**

- **Simplicity**: Minimalism is the guiding design principle of MinIO, allowing for out-of-the-box functionality. Simplicity reduces the chances of errors, increases uptime, and enhances reliability while also boosting performance.

- **High Performance**: MinIO is a world leader in object storage. On standard hardware, read/write speeds can reach up to 183 GB/sec and 171 GB/sec.

- **Scalability**: Multiple small to medium-sized, easily manageable clusters can be established, supporting the aggregation of multiple clusters into a super-large resource pool across data centers, rather than directly adopting a large-scale, centrally managed distributed cluster.

- **Cloud-Native**: Compliant with all native cloud computing architectures and build processes, and incorporates the latest technologies and concepts in cloud computing, making object storage more user-friendly for Kubernetes.
