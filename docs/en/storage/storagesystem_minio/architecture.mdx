The purpose of writing the "Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

The "concepts" introduced in the architecture are recommended to be linked to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts" in the text below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require separate documentation, they can be briefly explained in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to create a separate article titled "Deep Dive into XXXX" within the current directory for a more comprehensive introduction.

You can visit [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view the sample document.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality, which may contain the following elements:

- Core components: for example, Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., and illustrate the connections and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data flow: for example, the introduced resources, the dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption.
- Deployment architecture: for example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram to explain its meaning and the roles of its various parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section of "Core Concepts".
