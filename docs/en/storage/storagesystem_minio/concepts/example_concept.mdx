Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). 
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be merged into a single document for multiple concept introductions. Conversely, it is recommended to dedicate a separate document to each complex concept. 
For obscure and complicated concepts, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more accessible introduction.
