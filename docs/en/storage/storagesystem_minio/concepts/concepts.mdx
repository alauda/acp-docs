# Core Concepts

- **Erasure Coding (EC)**: MinIO employs Reed-Solomon erasure coding to break objects into data and parity shards, distributing them across multiple drives to ensure fault tolerance. For example, in a 16-drive setup, data can be split into 12 data shards and 4 parity shards, allowing the system to rebuild data even if up to 4 drives fail.

- **Server Pools & Erasure Sets**: MinIO Server Pools are logical groupings of storage resources, where each pool consists of multiple nodes sharing storage and compute capabilities. Within a pool, drives are automatically organized into one or more **Erasure Sets**.
  
  - **Data Distribution**: When an object is stored, it is split into data and parity shards and distributed across different drives within an erasure set.
  - **Redundancy Model**: Erasure sets form the fundamental unit of data redundancy, ensuring resiliency based on configured data-to-parity shard ratios.
  - **Scalability**: A single MinIO storage pool can contain multiple erasure sets, and new data is always written to the erasure set with the most available capacity.
