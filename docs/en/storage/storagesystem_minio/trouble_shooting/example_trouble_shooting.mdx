Introduce common problems that users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is minimal, it can be placed directly on a single page titled "Problem Handling". If there is more content, use "Problem Handling" as a directory, with each issue as a separate document.

You can visit [Problem Handling Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to view examples of corresponding documents.

# \<Title: Generally the Problem Name>

## Problem Description

Provide a detailed account of the environment in which the problem occurs, its impact, and the manifestation of the problem. Additionally, include the following supplementary information as appropriate:

- Problem Screenshot: Currently, it is recommended to use text descriptions. If the text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used, and users need to register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Related Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that led to the occurrence of this problem (it can be a single confirmed cause or several possible causes). Each cause must meet the following conditions:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and has been confirmed to lead to the problem, rather than a speculative or hypothetical reason.
2. Provide a detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How this cause triggered the problem.
   - The specific mechanism and process through which the problem occurs.

## Troubleshooting (Optional)

List the specific steps for troubleshooting the problem in detail. Through troubleshooting, users can identify the most likely or certain cause among multiple possibilities and use appropriate solutions to resolve the issue. Troubleshooting should pay attention to:

- If there is only one root cause, then troubleshooting steps need to be provided, preferably in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different troubleshooting steps, use a tertiary heading format to list each root cause, and provide detailed troubleshooting steps under each root cause.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this secondary title should be “Solution”)

Specific considerations, prerequisites, and steps required to resolve the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the secondary title name shall be “Solution”; if there are multiple root causes, and each root cause has a different solution, each solution should use a separate secondary title, naming them “Solution for Root Cause 1”, “Solution for Root Cause N”, etc.

### Considerations (Optional)

Important considerations that need to be noted before beginning operations. Failure to read this section carefully may lead to operation failures or even more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that need to be met before starting operational steps.

### Operational Steps (If there are no considerations or prerequisites, this tertiary heading can be omitted)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list format; if the steps are complicated, additional headings can be inserted between multiple steps for distinction, in which case, a quaternary heading format should be used to list each step, followed by a detailed list of steps in ordered format under each one.
- If operations are performed on a container platform, provide detailed steps for each operation; if on a third-party platform or other software, only the key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For operations not on container platforms, if the details are too extensive, we cannot ensure timely updates to the documentation in the event of interface changes, which may lead to many issues. To ensure long-term usability of the document, the following principles should be followed when describing operational steps on third-party platforms:
  >
  > - Emphasize core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid excessive reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain the generality and flexibility of the operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic flow of the operations.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this secondary title should be deleted)

The content in this section is consistent with the solution for Root Cause 1 and will not be reiterated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of this problem (suggestions, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

Can include some content that is used in the documentation but is inconvenient to place in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
