# Adding a Storage Pool

A storage pool refers to a logical partition used for storing data. Different types of underlying storage can be used simultaneously within the same storage cluster to meet various business needs.

In addition to the storage pools created during the configuration of object storage, you can also add additional storage pools.

## Notes

Adding a storage pool will cause a brief interruption in the MinIO service, but it will automatically recover to a normal state afterward.

## Procedure

1. Go to **Administrator**.

2. Click on **Storage Management** > **Object Storage** in the left navigation bar.

3. Under the **Cluster Information** tab, scroll down to the **Storage Pool** section and click **Add Storage Pool**.

4. Configure the relevant parameters according to the instructions below.

   | Parameter         | Description                                                                                                   |
   |-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Underlying Storage** | The underlying storage used by the MinIO cluster. Please select an existing storage class created in the current cluster, with TopoLVM recommended.   |
   | **Storage Nodes**  | Select the storage nodes required for the MinIO cluster. It is recommended to use 4-16 storage nodes; the platform will deploy 1 storage service for each selected storage node.<br />**Note**: When using 3 storage nodes, to ensure reliability, 2 storage services will be deployed for each node. |
   | **Single Storage Volume** | The capacity of a single storage volume PVC. Each storage service manages 1 storage volume, and once the capacity of a single storage volume is entered, the platform will automatically calculate the storage pool capacity and other information, which can be viewed in the **Storage Pool Overview**. |

5. Click **Confirm**.
