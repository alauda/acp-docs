# Monitoring and Alerts

Object storage provides out-of-the-box capabilities for monitoring metric collection and alert notifications. It enables monitoring and alerts from various aspects, such as storage clusters and services, and supports the configuration of notification policies.

The intuitively presented monitoring data can be used to support decision-making for operations inspection or performance tuning, while a comprehensive alert and notification mechanism will help ensure the stable operation of the storage system.

## Monitoring

By default, the platform collects the status of object storage clusters and services. You can view real-time monitoring data for metrics on the **Monitoring** tab under **Storage Management** > **Object Storage**.

### Storage Overview

Monitor the health status of storage, the status of storage services, and the usage of cluster raw capacity. You can check the reasons for alerts when the storage status is abnormal.

### Cluster Monitoring

Monitor the raw capacity usage and the read/write rates of the storage cluster.

### Object Monitoring

Monitor the total number of access requests and the number of erroneous access requests for objects.

## Alerts

The platform has a set of default alert policies enabled. Alerts will be automatically triggered when resources are abnormal or when monitoring data reaches a warning state. The preset policies can already meet common operational needs, such as component and cluster status alerts, device capacity alerts, and user data alerts.

### Configure Notifications

To receive alerts in a timely manner, it is recommended that you set notification policies in the operations center: send alert information to relevant personnel via email, SMS, and other means, prompting them to take necessary measures to resolve issues or prevent failures.

### Handle Alerts

- If the monitoring indicates that the storage cluster is in an `Alert` state, it means that an alert has been triggered and the related abnormalities may lead to a failure. Please promptly check the details of the **Real-time Alerts** and locate the issue based on the cause of the fault.

- If the monitoring indicates that the storage cluster is in a `Failure` state, it signifies that the storage cluster can no longer operate normally. Please immediately identify the issue and troubleshoot.

The following table shows the meanings of the alert levels used in preset policies, which can serve as a reference for establishing your alert handling principles.

| Alert Level | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------- |
| **Disaster** | The resource corresponding to the alert rule has failed, causing a disruption in the platform's business and significant data loss. |
| **Severe**   | The resource corresponding to the alert rule has known issues that may cause platform function failures, affecting normal business operations. |
| **Warning**  | The resource corresponding to the alert rule has operational risks that, if not addressed in time, may affect normal business operations. |

### Failure Review

The **Alert History** records all previously triggered alerts that no longer require processing. When reviewing failures using the alert history, you may need to answer the following questions to effectively summarize experiences:

- What was the specific abnormal situation when the incident occurred?

- If a certain alert in the alert list keeps reappearing, are there any patterns? Can it be avoided in advance before it occurs again?

- The timeline shows a surge in alerts during a particular period; was it due to force majeure or an operational accident? Does the operational plan need adjustment?
