# Data Disaster Recovery

MinIO supports the establishment of a disaster recovery center through remote data backup or active-active deployment to ensure that original data is not lost or damaged in the event of a disaster, thereby guaranteeing data security and reliability.

## Applicable Scenarios

- **Hot Backup**: There are two data centers in the same city or in different locations, one primary and one backup. Data is replicated in real-time from the primary cluster to the backup cluster to ensure data consistency. When a disaster occurs in the primary cluster, business traffic can be seamlessly switched to the backup cluster to ensure business continuity.

- **City-Level Active-Active**: In a city-level active-active (multi-cluster) architecture, there are two data centers located in different clusters. Both data centers are active and can receive business traffic simultaneously. When one data center encounters a disaster, business can continue running uninterrupted in the other data center.

## Terminology

- **Primary Cluster**: Refers to the cluster that is currently active and processing business requests. It is the source of the data or the initiator of operations. In the primary cluster, data is created, modified, or updated, and business traffic is first sent to this cluster for processing.

- **Target Cluster**: Refers to the cluster that receives data replication, migration, or failover. It is typically in a backup or standby state, waiting to receive data from the primary cluster or take over business traffic. When the primary cluster fails or needs to switch, the target cluster will receive data copies from the primary cluster or take over business traffic to ensure business continuity. In an active-active scenario, both clusters can serve as each other's target cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Both the primary cluster and the target cluster must have external network access enabled. For specific configuration methods, please refer to [Create Object Storage](/storage/storagesystem_minio/installation.mdx).

- The primary cluster must use the **LoadBalancer** access method, while the target cluster is recommended to support **load balancing** functionality.

- The primary cluster and the target cluster must use the same access protocol, i.e., either both use HTTP or both use HTTPS.

- When using the HTTPS protocol, both the primary cluster and the target cluster need to configure DNS resolution for themselves and each other.

- When using the HTTPS protocol, it is recommended that both the primary cluster and the target cluster use CA-signed certificates to ensure secure and trusted communication; if self-signed certificates are used, both parties must import and trust each other's self-signed certificates to establish a secure HTTPS connection successfully.

## Operation Steps

1. Enter **Administrator**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Object Storage**.

3. On the **Data Disaster Recovery** tab, click **Add Target Cluster**.

4. Configure the relevant parameters for the target cluster according to the following instructions.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                   |
   | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Access Address** | The external access address of the target cluster, starting with http\:// or https\://.     |
   | **Access Key**   | The Access Key ID for the target cluster. A unique identifier associated with the private access key; used in conjunction with the private access key to encrypt requests. |
   | **Secret Key**   | The private access key used in conjunction with the Access Key ID to encrypt requests, identify the sender, and prevent request modification. | 

5. Click **Add**.

   - Upon successful addition, you will be able to view the status of the target cluster and the synchronization status between clusters.

     | Parameter       | Description                                                                                             |
     | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | **Cluster Status**  | The status of the target cluster, including **Healthy**, **Abnormal**, or **Unknown**.                                   |
     | **Buckets**      | The number of buckets pending synchronization and those already synchronized.<br /><ul><li>In hot backup scenarios, pending synchronization refers to the number of buckets that the primary cluster needs to synchronize with the target cluster.</li><li>In city-level active-active scenarios, pending synchronization refers to the total number of buckets that need to be synchronized between the primary and target clusters.</li></ul> |
     | **Objects**      | The number of objects that failed to synchronize in the bucket.<br />**Note**: This number is for reference only, as MinIO synchronizes related file configurations during synchronization.                     |
     | **Network Traffic Rate** | The network ingress and egress rate of the primary cluster.<br /><ul><li>In hot backup scenarios, the network ingress rate is always 0.</li><li>In city-level active-active scenarios, both ingress and egress rates have data.</li></ul>                |

   - If the addition of the target cluster fails, you can click **Re-add** to clear the cluster information and return to the add target cluster page, where you can re-add the target cluster.

## Related Operations

When disaster recovery is no longer needed, you can click **Remove Target Cluster**. Removing the target cluster does not delete the data that has been synchronized; if any data is currently synchronizing, it will be interrupted.
