:::tip

If the parent module requires manual intervention for the upgrade process, it is necessary to provide an upgrade document; otherwise, it is not required.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade procedure, upgrade configuration, rollback procedure, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade procedures between different versions, the upgrade document needs to be organized into a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for each version (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view examples of the corresponding documents.
