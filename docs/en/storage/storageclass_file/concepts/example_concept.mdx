Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.). If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document for multiple concept introductions; conversely, it is recommended that each concept corresponds to a separate document for introduction. For obscure and complex concepts, it is advised to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more accessible introduction.

You can visit [Concept Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) to view examples of corresponding documents.
