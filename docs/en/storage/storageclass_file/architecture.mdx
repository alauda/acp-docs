:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

The "concepts" introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding sections in the "Core Concepts" section below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require a separate document for introduction, they can be briefly explained in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to provide a more comprehensive introduction.

You can visit the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to see example documents.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality, which may include the following content:

- Core Components: such as Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., and depict the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: such as introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and how resources are consumed, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description of the diagram below the architecture diagram, explaining its meaning and the roles of each part within it.

Briefly introduce the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts".
