1. Overview

The HowTo document is a practical-oriented technical document that focuses on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. It combines product features with real-world applications, providing users with comprehensive guidance for solutions.

2. Document Features

HowTo documents have the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios
- High practicality: Directly answers the question "How to achieve a specific goal," emphasizing practical operational guidance
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation
- Replicability: Users can follow the steps in the document to reproduce solutions in similar scenarios

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify users' specific needs and pain points
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution
- Evaluate implementation conditions and possible limitations

Audience Positioning

- Identify the target readers (e.g., developers, operational personnel, system administrators, etc.)
- Assess the readers' technical background and knowledge level
- Understand the readers' work scenarios and environments
