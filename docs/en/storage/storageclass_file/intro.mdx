1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section is the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, key functionalities, target users, and expected use cases, providing readers with a clear initial understanding.

Generally, we determine whether to include the sections of Introduction, Advantages, and Function Overview based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for a single functional module, they can be combined in the same document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

There can be many points involved in a product or functional module. Adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: It can serve as a consistent acknowledgment, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: It provides readers with a clear product background, facilitating deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Improve Efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repeating explanations for basic product knowledge.

3. How to Structure the Introduction Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Use concise language to summarize the core points of the product, avoiding lengthy descriptions.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functionalities of the product.
- Audience-Focused: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information relevant to their concerns.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the value of product functionalities, allowing users to quickly understand and use the product features.

We will find some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions:

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position and competitive advantages in the industry.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive and should be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions:

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the features and advantages of the individual module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by the individual module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Apart from the introduction itself, if other sections are lengthy or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This section provides a short description. Specifically, it introduces the expected use of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module aimed at cloud-native applications, built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture that decouples the underlying infrastructure and achieves unified management across multi-cloud and multi-cluster environments, significantly simplifying the application cloud migration process for enterprises and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.

## \<Product/Module> Advantages
