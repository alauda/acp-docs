1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening for product documentation or functional modules, providing an overall description of the product or functionality. It covers core concepts, main features, target users, and intended uses, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

Generally, we will decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview in a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform-type products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be combined into the same document.

2. Importance of Introduction

The points involved in a product or functional module may be numerous. Adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: It can serve as an opening to provide a consistent perception, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: It provides readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repeated explanations of basic product knowledge.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functions of the product.
- Audience-Focused: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information relevant to their interests.

4. Special Characteristics of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for functional module descriptions in documents. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the functional value of the product, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize the product's features.

We will notice some differences between product-level and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introduction

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all the core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product will be more comprehensive and need to be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introduction

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibility of this module within the product.
- **Module Characteristics**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Besides this introduction, if other sections are too lengthy or relatively complex, they can be made independent.

This is a brief description. Specifically introduces the expected use of \<Product/Module Name>. For example:

\<Container Management> is a container management module for cloud-native applications built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupled from underlying infrastructure, achieving unified management of multi-cloud and multi-cluster, significantly simplifying enterprise application migration processes and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. With container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly set up an enterprise-level container cloud management platform.

## \<Product/Module> Advantages
