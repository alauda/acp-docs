1. Overview

The HowTo document is a practical-oriented technical document focused on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. It combines product features with real-world applications, providing users with comprehensive solution guidance.

2. Document Features

The HowTo document has the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios.
- High practicality: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a particular goal," focusing on practical operational guidance.
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
- Replicability: Users can follow the document's steps to reproduce solutions in similar scenarios.

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements need to be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify the user’s specific needs and pain points.
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution.
- Assess implementation conditions and potential limitations.

Audience定位

- Identify the target readers (e.g. developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.).
- Evaluate readers' technical background and knowledge level.
- Understand readers' working scenarios and environments.
