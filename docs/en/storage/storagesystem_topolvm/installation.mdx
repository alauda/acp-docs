# Install

Local storage is a software-defined server-local storage solution that provides a simple, easy-to-maintain, and high-performance local storage service capability. Based on the community's TopoLVM solution, it achieves persistent volume orchestration management of local storage through the system's LVM approach.

## Prerequisites

The lvm2 package must be installed on each node of the storage cluster. If not installed, please execute the `yum install -y lvm2` command on the node.

## Steps

1. Go to **Platform Management**.

2. In the left navigation bar, click **Storage Management** > **Local Storage**.

3. Click **Configure Now**.

4. On the **Install Operator** wizard page, click **Start Deployment**.

   - When the page automatically proceeds to the next step, it indicates that the Operator deployment was successful.

   - If the deployment fails, please refer to the interface prompts for resolution. Then click **Clean Up** and redeploy the Operator.

5. On the **Create Cluster** wizard page, add devices.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Select Node** | Node with at least 1 bare disk.                                                                                                                                                              |
   | **Device Class**  | Each device class corresponds to a set of storage devices with the same characteristics. It is recommended to fill in the name based on the disk nature, such as *hdd*, *ssd*.                                                              |
   | **Device Type** | Only disk types are supported.                                                                                                                                                                     |
   | **Storage Device** | For example, */dev/sda*. If there are multiple disks, they can be added one by one.                                                                                                                                                   |
   | **Snapshot**   | When enabled, it supports creating PVC snapshots and using the snapshots to configure new PVCs for quick backup and recovery of business data. <br />If the snapshot was not enabled when creating the storage, you can still enable it as needed in the **Operations** section of the storage cluster details page. <br />**Note**: Before use, please ensure that the [Volume Snapshot Plugin](/configure/storage/functions/snapshot_con.mdx) has been deployed for the current cluster. |

   - Click Next. When the page automatically proceeds to the next step, it indicates that the cluster deployment was successful.

   - If the creation fails, please refer to the interface prompts and clean up resources in a timely manner.

6. On the **Create Storage Class** wizard page, configure the relevant parameters.

   | Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
   | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Name**   | The name of the storage class. It must be unique within the current cluster.                                                                                                                                           |
   | **Display Name** | A name that helps you identify or filter, such as a Chinese description of the storage class.                                                                                                                                  |
   | **Device Class**  | The device class is a way to categorize storage devices in TopoLVM. Each device class corresponds to a set of storage devices with the same characteristics. If there are no special requirements, you can use the **Auto-Allocated** device class from the cluster.                                                                                |
   | **File System** | - **XFS** is a high-performance journaling file system adept at handling parallel I/O workloads, supporting large file processing and providing smooth data transfer. <br />- **EXT4** is a journaling file system in Linux, offering extent file storage methods and supporting large file processing. The file system can reach a capacity of 1 EiB, with a maximum supported file size of 16 TiB. |
   | **Recycling Policy** | The recycling policy for persistent volumes. <br />- Delete: When the persistent volume claim is deleted, the bound persistent volume is also deleted. <br />- Retain: Even if the persistent volume claim is deleted, the bound persistent volume will still be retained.                                                                                |
   | **Access Mode** | ReadWriteOnce (RWO): Can be mounted by a single node in read-write mode.                                                                                                                                 |
   | **Allocation Project** | This type of persistent volume claim can only be created in specific projects. <br />If no project is assigned temporarily, the project can also be **Updated** later.                                                                                                            |

7. Click **Next** and wait for the resource creation to complete.
