:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, and so on.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between versions, the upgrade document needs to be formatted as a directory, providing separate upgrade documents for different versions (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide," "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to see examples of the corresponding document.
