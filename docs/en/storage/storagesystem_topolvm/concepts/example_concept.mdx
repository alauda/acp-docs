Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional modules (including parameter explanations, examples, etc.).
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document for multiple concept introductions; otherwise, it is recommended to dedicate a separate document for each concept.
For obscure or complex concepts, it is advisable to write a separate "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" article in the current directory for a more accessible introduction.

You can refer to [concept document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) for examples of corresponding documents.
