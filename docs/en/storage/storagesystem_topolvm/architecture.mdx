:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

The "concepts" introduced in the architecture are recommended to be linked to the corresponding chapters in the "Core Concepts" section below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require separate documentation, a brief explanation can be made in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory to explain the concepts thoroughly.

You can refer to the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) for sample documentation.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality, which can encompass the following contents:

- Core components: such as Operator, Jobs, Middleware, etc., and depict the connections and roles of each component within the diagram.
- Data flow: including the resources introduced, the dependency relationships between resources, and the process of resource consumption.
- Deployment architecture: for example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram to explain the meaning of the image and the role of each part within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires more detailed clarification, please link to the corresponding chapter in "Core Concepts".
