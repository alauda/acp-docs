Introduce common issues that users may encounter along with their solutions. If the content is minimal, include it directly on the "Troubleshooting" single page. If the content is extensive, use "Troubleshooting" as a table of contents, with each issue as a separate document.

You can visit [Troubleshooting Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to see corresponding document examples.

:::

# \<Title: Usually the Name of the Issue>

## Issue Description

Detail the environment in which the issue occurs, the scope of its impact, and the symptoms of the problem, while also adding the following supplementary information as appropriate:

- Issue Screenshot: Currently, it is recommended to prioritize text descriptions. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, use screenshots, and users need to register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Related Logs: Present error messages, system logs, debug information, etc., in code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to the issue (these can be single confirmed causes or multiple possible causes). Each cause needs to meet the following criteria:

1. It must be an actual reason that has occurred and is confirmed to lead to the issue, rather than a speculative or imagined reason.
2. Provide a detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How the reason triggers the issue.
   - The specific mechanism and process by which the issue occurs.

## Issue Troubleshooting (optional)

Specify the concrete steps for troubleshooting the issue. Through troubleshooting, users can identify the most likely or definite reason among multiple causes and use appropriate solutions to resolve the issue. Troubleshooting should pay attention to:

- If there is only one root cause, provide troubleshooting steps, and it is recommended to display them in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes and different troubleshooting steps, list each root cause in a tertiary heading format, and each root cause must provide detailed troubleshooting steps underneath.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (Use this title format for multiple root causes. If there is a single root cause, this secondary title should be "Solution.")

Specific notes, prerequisites, and steps for resolving the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the secondary title should be “Solution”; for multiple root causes, each root cause's corresponding solution should be under a separate secondary title named "Solution for Root Cause 1", "Solution for Root Cause N", etc.

### Precautions (optional)

Precautions to be taken before starting operations; failure to read this section carefully may result in operation failures or even more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (optional)

Conditions that must be met before starting the operation steps.

### Operation Steps (If there are no precautions or prerequisites, this tertiary heading can be omitted)

- Generally, use an ordered list format to display operation steps; if the operation steps are complex, additional headings can be added between steps to distinguish them; in this case, a quaternary heading format can be used for each step, with specific steps listed in ordered list format.
- If the operation is being performed in a container platform, list the detailed steps for each operation comprehensively; if operating in a third-party platform or other software, only provide the key steps accordingly.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if described in excessive detail, we cannot ensure timely updates to documentation when interface changes occur, potentially leading to various issues. To ensure long-term usability of the documentation, steps for third-party platform operations should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Emphasize core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid excessive reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in operation step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose of the operations and the basic processes involved.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (Use this title format for multiple root causes. If there is a single root cause, this secondary title should be deleted.)

This section will have the same format as the solution for Root Cause 1; redundancies are omitted here.

## Preventive Measures (optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of the issue (recommendations, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (optional)

Content that is used in the documentation but is not convenient to include in the body, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
