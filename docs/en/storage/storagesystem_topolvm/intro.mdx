1. What is the Introduction?

The "Introduction" section is the opening of product documentation or functional modules, providing an overview of the product or functionality. It covers core concepts, main features, target users, and expected applications, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

We generally decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview sections in a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products with multiple core modules), it is recommended to split these contents into separate documents; for single function modules, they can be combined in the same document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

There may be many points involved in a product or functional module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Provide a consistent recognition as an opening, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Offer a clear product background for readers, facilitating deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repeated explanations of fundamental product knowledge.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Chapter

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product in simple language, avoiding lengthy descriptions.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main features of the product.
- Audience-Centric: Consider the background of the target audience, providing the information they care about.

4. Special Aspects of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps teams better convey the product's functional value, enabling users to quickly understand and use the product's features.

There are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all the core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The scenarios applicable to the product will be broader, requiring an explanation based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of this module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.

# Introduction

## \<Product/Module> Introduction

> Besides this introduction section, if other sections are too long or relatively complex, they can be opened independently.

This section is a brief description. It specifically introduces what the expected use of \<Product/Module Name> is. For example:

\<Container Management> is a cloud-native application container management module built on Kubernetes. It is the core of ACP, based on a native multi-cluster architecture, decoupling underlying infrastructure to achieve unified management of multi-cloud and multi-cluster scenarios, significantly simplifying the application cloud migration process for enterprises, and effectively reducing operational management and labor costs. Through container management, you can easily create Kubernetes clusters and quickly build an enterprise-grade container cloud management platform.
