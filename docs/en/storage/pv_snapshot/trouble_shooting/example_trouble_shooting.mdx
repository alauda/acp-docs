Introduce common issues users may encounter along with their solutions. If the content is minimal, it can be placed directly on a single page titled "Troubleshooting". If there is a lot of content, use "Troubleshooting" as a directory, with each issue documented separately.

You can visit [Troubleshooting document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to view examples of the corresponding documents.

# \<Title: Generally the name of the issue>

## Problem Description

Provide detailed information about the environment where the problem occurs, its impact scope, and the observed symptoms, and include the following supplementary information where appropriate:

- Screenshots: It is currently recommended to use text descriptions primarily. If the text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used, and users need to register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Related logs: Include error messages, system logs, debug information, etc., in a code block.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this issue (which can be a single confirmed cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause must meet the following criteria:

1. It must be an actual cause that has occurred and been confirmed to lead to this issue, not a speculative or hypothetical cause.
2. A detailed causal analysis should be provided, including:
   - How this cause triggers the issue.
   - The specific mechanism and process by which the issue occurs.

## Problem Troubleshooting (Optional)

Outline the specific steps for troubleshooting the issue in detail. By performing troubleshooting, users can identify the most likely or certain cause from multiple options and apply the appropriate solution to resolve the issue. When troubleshooting, pay attention to:

- If there is only one root cause, provide the troubleshooting steps. It is recommended to present this information in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different troubleshooting steps, use third-level headings to list each root cause, with detailed troubleshooting steps provided under each cause.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This title format is used for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be "Solution")

Detail the specific considerations, prerequisites, and steps for resolving this issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level title will be "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes with different solutions, each solution will have its own second-level title, e.g., "Solution for Root Cause 1", "Solution for Root Cause N", etc.

### Considerations (Optional)

Things to note before starting the operation; failure to read this carefully could lead to operational failure or even more severe consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that must be met before beginning operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level title can be omitted if there are no considerations or prerequisites)

- Operational steps are generally presented in an ordered list. If the steps are complicated, additional headers can be added for distinction; in this case, a fourth-level heading can be used to list each step, with specific steps detailed in an ordered list under each one.
- If the operations are conducted within a container platform, provide detailed steps for each operation. If performed on a third-party platform or other software, only the key steps should be outlined.

  > Reason: For operations on non-container platforms, if described too in detail, we cannot ensure timely updates to the documentation with changes in their interfaces, which may lead to many issues. To ensure the long-term usability of the documentation, the description of steps for third-party platform operations should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Focus on core steps and key actions.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain universality and flexibility in the description of operational steps.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic process of the operations.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This title format is used for multiple root causes; if there is only one root cause, this second-level title should be removed)

This section follows the same format as the solution for Root Cause 1, and therefore will not be further elaborated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of the issue (suggestions, commands, actions, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can store content used in the documentation that is not suitable for inclusion in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
