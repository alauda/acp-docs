:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation, an upgrade document must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes between different versions, the upgrade document should be structured as a directory, with corresponding upgrade documents for different versions included in that directory (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) for examples of the corresponding document.
