1. Overview

HowTo documents are practical technical documents that focus on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. They combine product features with practical application scenarios to provide users with comprehensive solution guidance.

2. Document Characteristics

HowTo documents have the following core characteristics:

- Scenario-oriented: Provides end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios
- Highly practical: Directly answers the question of "how to achieve a specific goal," focusing on practical operational guidance
- Completeness: Covers the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation
- Replicability: Users can reproduce the solution in similar scenarios by following the document's steps

3. Writing Preparation

Before starting to write a HowTo document, the following elements must be clarified:

Target Scenario Analysis

- Identify the user's specific needs and pain points
- Determine the applicable scope of the solution
- Evaluate implementation conditions and potential limitations

Audience Targeting

- Identify target readers (e.g., developers, operations personnel, system administrators, etc.)
- Evaluate the technical background and knowledge level of the readers
- Understand the working scenarios and environments of the readers
