:::tip
The purpose of writing a "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

Any "concepts" introduced in the architecture should be linked to the corresponding section titled "Core Concepts" below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require individual documentation, a brief explanation can be provided in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" within the current directory for a more detailed introduction.

You can visit the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to see a sample document.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams related to this functionality. The diagrams may contain the following content:

- Core Components: For instance, Operator, Tasks, Middleware, etc., illustrating the relationships and functions of each component.
- Data Flow: Such as the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: Including aspects like multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram to explain the meaning of the image and the role of its various parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a particular concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in "Core Concepts."
