# Overview

The Alauda Container Platform web console provides a graphical user interface to visualize your project data and perform administrative, management, and troubleshooting tasks. The web console is designed to enhance user experience by organizing platform functionality into distinct perspectives that cater to different user roles and workflows.

## Browser Compatibility

The web console supports modern browsers based on the Chromium engine (Blink rendering engine).
For the best experience, use the latest version of a Chromium-based browser.

Browsers that do not use the Chromium engine may not be fully compatible.
If you encounter any display or functionality issues when using an unsupported browser, please contact the technical support team.

## Navigating the Web Console

### Portal Page

Upon logging into the web console, you are directed to the Portal page by default. The Portal page displays all available view cards supported by the web console. These cards serve as entry points to different functional areas of the platform.

### View Switching

You can switch between different views using the view switcher located in the upper-left corner of the web console. This allows for seamless navigation between different functional contexts within the platform.

### Primary Views

The Alauda Container Platform web console offers several key views, each tailored to specific user roles and tasks:

#### Container Platform View

The Container Platform view is designed for Developers. In this view, Developers can manage resources within their Projects, such as:

- Application workloads
- Storage volumes
- Configurations
- Service bindings
- Routes and networking resources

#### Platform Management View

The Platform Management view is oriented toward Administrators. This view allows Administrators to:

- Create or import clusters
- Install and manage Operators
- Configure platform-wide settings
- Monitor system health and metrics
- Manage platform security

#### Project Management View

The Project Management view focuses on Project-level administration, enabling users to:

- Create and configure Projects
- Manage Project quotas and resource limits
- Administer Project members and role bindings
- Configure Project-level policies

### Overview Pages

Each view typically includes an Overview page that provides a summary of relevant information. For example, the Platform Management Overview page displays platform-wide data, including:

- Total number of Projects
- Cluster status and health
- Resource utilization metrics
- Recent events and alerts
- Platform health indicators

These Overview pages offer at-a-glance insights into the status and performance of your containerized infrastructure, helping users quickly assess system health and identify areas requiring attention.
