# Introduction

The platform integrates with Kubernetes events, logging significant status changes and various operational state changes of Kubernetes resources. It also provides capabilities for storage, querying, and visualization. When abnormalities occur with resources such as clusters, nodes, or Pods, users can analyze events to determine specific causes.

Based on the root causes identified from the events, users can [create alert policies](../monitor/functions/manage_alert.mdx) for workloads. When the number of critical events reaches the alert threshold, alerts can be automatically triggered to notify relevant personnel for timely intervention, thereby reducing operational risks on the platform.

## Usage Limitations

This feature relies on the logging system. Please ensure that the ACP Log Collector and ACP Log Storage plugins are installed within the platform beforehand.
