# Introduction

## Module Overview

The platform integrates with Kubernetes events, logging significant status changes and various operational state changes of Kubernetes resources. It also provides capabilities for storage, querying, and visualization. When abnormalities occur with resources such as clusters, nodes, or Pods, users can analyze events to determine specific causes.

Based on the root causes identified from the events, users can [create alert policies](../monitor/functions/manage_alert.mdx) for computing components. When the number of critical events reaches the alert threshold, alerts can be automatically triggered to notify relevant personnel for timely intervention, thereby reducing operational risks on the platform.

## Functionality Overview

The events module primarily offers the following functionalities:

**Event Collection and Persistence**

- **Automatic Collection**: The module will automatically collect all events occurring in the Kubernetes cluster, including Pod creation, deletion, scheduling failures, etc.
- **Persistent Storage**: Collected events will be stored persistently to ensure users can backtrack historical events as needed.

**Event Querying**

- **Flexible Querying**: Users can query events using various conditions (such as event type, namespace, resource name, etc.) to quickly locate issues.
- **Time Range Filtering**: Supports querying events by time ranges, allowing users to view cluster activities within specific time periods.

**Event Summary and Display**

- **Event Summary**: The module will summarize events and generate statistical information to help users understand the overall status of the cluster.

## Use Cases

The events module is suitable for the following scenarios:

- **Cluster Monitoring**: By monitoring Kubernetes events in real-time, users can promptly discover abnormalities in the cluster.
- **Troubleshooting**: When issues arise within the cluster, users can swiftly locate the root cause by querying event logs.
- **Performance Optimization**: By analyzing event data, users can understand resource usage in the cluster and optimize resource allocation.

## Usage Limitations

This feature relies on the logging system. Please ensure that the Log Collector and Log Store plugins are deployed within the platform beforehand.
