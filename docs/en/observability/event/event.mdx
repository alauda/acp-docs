# Events

## Operation Procedures

1. Click on **Operations Center** > **Events** in the left navigation bar.

   **Tip**: Switch the cluster to view events using the dropdown selection box in the top navigation bar.

## Event Overview

The events page displays an overview of significant events that occurred in the last 30 minutes by default (you can choose or customize the time range), as well as records of resource events.

- **Significant Event Overview**: This card shows the reason for significant events and the number of resources that experienced such events within the selected time range.
  - **Note**: When the same resource experiences this type of event multiple times, the resource count will not accumulate.

  - For example: If the resource count for node restart events is 20, it indicates that within the selected time range, 20 resources encountered such events, and the same resource may have experienced it multiple times.
- **Resource Event Records**: Below the significant event overview area, all event records that meet the query conditions within the selected time range are displayed. You can filter for respective types of events by clicking on the significant event card, or you can expand the view and input query conditions to search. The query conditions are as follows:

  - **Resource Type**: The type of Kubernetes resource that experienced the event, e.g., Pod.

  - **Namespace**: The namespace of the Kubernetes resource where the event occurred.

  - **Event Reason**: The reason for the occurrence of the event.

  - **Event Level**: The significance of the event, such as Warning.

  - **Resource Name**: The name of the Kubernetes resource that experienced the event. Multiple names can be selected or entered.

:::tip

- Click the view icon next to the resource name in the event record to view detailed information about the event in the pop-up **Event Details** dialog.
- The color of the icon to the left of the event reason indicates the event level. A green icon indicates that the level of this event is `Normal`, and this event can be ignored; an orange icon signifies that the level of this event is `Warning`, indicating that there is an anomaly with the resource and this event should be monitored to prevent incidents.
