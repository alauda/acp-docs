# Introduction

The Inspection module is a core component of the ACP platform's observability suite that provides automated inspection and assessment capabilities for comprehensive resource monitoring and risk management.

This module delivers four essential inspection capabilities:

- **Resource inspection** for automated assessment of clusters, nodes, pods, certificates, and other platform resources to identify risks and usage patterns
- **Real-time monitoring** for live tracking of inspection task progress and immediate visibility into resource operational status
- **Visual reporting** for intuitive display of inspection results including resource risks, usage information, and operational insights
- **Report generation** for downloadable inspection reports in PDF or Excel formats with comprehensive analysis and recommendations

By integrating these capabilities with role-based access controls and automated assessment algorithms, it enables organizations to reduce manual inspection costs, proactively identify resource anomalies, mitigate business risks, and maintain optimal platform performance through systematic health assessments.

## Usage Limitations

- Some inspection items on the platform depend on clusters having monitoring components installed. Please ensure that each cluster has either the ACP Monitoring with Prometheus plugin or the ACP Monitoring with VictoriaMetrics plugin installed in advance.
- The platform inspection supports sending inspection results via email. Please ensure that the email notification server configuration has been completed in advance.

With the container platform's inspection functionality, users can manage and maintain the container environment more efficiently, enhancing system stability and security.
