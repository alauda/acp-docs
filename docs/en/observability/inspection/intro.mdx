## Module Introduction

To help enterprise customers reduce the cost of manual inspections, the platform's basic inspection functionality is designed based on experience in performing manual inspections for enterprise clients. It enables enterprise clients to understand the operation status of all business resources on the platform in real-time, promptly identify anomalies, and mitigate business risks.

- Supports online execution of inspection tasks, including resource risk inspections of all clusters, nodes, pods, and certificate resources on the platform, as well as usage inspections of regular resources, allowing real-time tracking of inspection progress;
- After the inspection is completed, the results are visually displayed, including resource risks and usage information;
- Supports downloading inspection reports in PDF or Excel format;
- To ensure the security of client data, only users with appropriate access permissions are allowed to use the inspection functionality.

## Module Advantages

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports inspections of all critical resources on the platform, ensuring nothing is overlooked.

- **Visual Presentation**: Inspection results are displayed through an intuitive visual interface, facilitating quick identification of issues.
- **Flexible Reporting**: Supports downloading inspection reports in PDF or Excel formats to meet the needs of different users.

## Module Use Cases

- **Daily Operations**: Regularly performing inspection tasks to ensure normal operation and security of platform resources.
- **Fault Diagnosis**: Quickly locating resource risks or usage anomalies through the inspection functionality when problems arise.
- **Compliance Audits**: Downloading inspection reports for compliance audits and internal reviews to ensure the platform meets relevant standards and regulations.
- **Resource Optimization**: Analyzing resource usage information to identify waste or shortages and optimize resource allocation.

## Usage Limitations

- Some inspection items on the platform depend on clusters having monitoring components installed. Please ensure that each cluster has either the Monitoring with Prometheus plugin or the Monitoring with VictoriaMetrics plugin installed in advance.
- The platform inspection supports sending inspection results via email. Please ensure that the email notification server configuration has been completed in advance.

With the container platform's inspection functionality, users can manage and maintain the container environment more efficiently, enhancing system stability and security.
