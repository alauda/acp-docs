# Inspection

## Execute Inspection

1. Click on **Operation Center** > **Inspection** > **Basic Inspection** in the left navigation bar.

   **Tip**: The inspection page displays the inspection data information from the most recent inspection. During the inspection process, you can view the resource data of completed inspections in real-time.

2. On the Basic Inspection page, the following actions are supported:

   - **Execute Inspection**: Click the **Inspection** button in the upper right corner of the page to perform an inspection on the platform.

   - **Download Inspection Report**: Click the **Download Report** button in the upper right corner of the page, select the report format (PDF and Excel) in the pop-up dialog, and click to download, which will download the corresponding format report to your local machine.

     - The PDF format inspection report does not include resource risk details page data; 

     - The Excel format inspection report contains all data from the inspection; 

     - Supports simultaneous download of both formats of reports.

## Inspection Report Explanation

### Most Recent Inspection

In the **Most Recent Inspection** information area, you can view relevant information from the most recent inspection:

- **Inspection Time**: The start and end time of the most recent inspection.

- **Total Number of Inspection Resources**: The total number of resources (clusters, nodes, pods, certificates) inspected in the most recent inspection.

- **Risks**: The number of resources at risk, including those classified as **Fault** and **Warning**.

### Resource Risk Inspection

In the **Resource Risk Inspection** page, you can view an overview of risk information for `global` clusters, self-built clusters, accessed clusters, and all nodes, pods, and certificates under these clusters.

Click the **Risk Details** button on the card of the corresponding resource type (**Cluster**, **Node**, **pod**, **Certificate**) to enter the risk details page for that resource type. On the details page, you can view the most recent inspection information for the resource, as well as the list of resources with faults and warnings.

- Click on the resource name to jump to the resource details page.

- Click the expand button on the right side of the **Name** field in the list to expand the judgment conditions and reasons for faults and warnings.

For explanations of the risk status judgment criteria (Fault, Warning) for each resource, refer to the table below.

**Note**: There are multiple conditions used to judge the faults and warnings for each resource type; when the inspection data of the resource matches any one of the judgment conditions, it is considered a piece of risk data.

| Resource Type  | Inspection Scope                                    | Fault Judgment Conditions                                                                                                      | Warning Judgment Conditions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
