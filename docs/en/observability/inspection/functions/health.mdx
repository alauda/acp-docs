# Component Health Status

The platform health status page presents statistical data on the health status of features that have been installed on the platform. When your account has management or auditing permissions related to the platform, you can also view detailed health data for specific features, including: a list of clusters that do not have the feature installed, the health status of clusters that have the feature installed, and detection data for components within clusters associated with the feature. This can help you quickly identify issues and improve the operational efficiency of the platform.

## Procedures to Operate

1. Navigate to the view page of installed products or the platform center (platform management, project management, operations center).

2. Click the question mark button at the top right corner of the navigation bar > **Platform Health Status**.

3. Check the feature card; the feature card displays the health status information of the feature. If there are abnormalities in the feature components, it will be reflected on the card as `fault`.

4. Click on the health/fault value on the feature card to expand the detailed health status page on the right side of the page, where you can view detailed issue information for the faulty components.
