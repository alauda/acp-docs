# Incomplete Call Chain Data

## Problem Description

The call chain query results exhibit the following issues of incomplete data:

- Recent queries (within the last 30 minutes) are missing some spans.
- Call chains older than 1 hour are experiencing disconnections.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Data Persistence Delay

The writing process in Elasticsearch requires a sequence of steps involving memory buffer → translog → segment files, which can result in visibility delays for the most recently written data.

### 2. Time Range Limitation

By default, when `jaeger-query` queries spans corresponding to call chains, the time range extends one hour before and after the start time of the span.

For instance, if a span starts at `08:12:30` and ends at `08:12:32`, the time range for querying that call chain would be from `07:12:30` to `09:12:32`.

Therefore, if the call chain spans over 1 hour, querying through this span may not yield a complete call chain.

## Solution for Root Cause 1

Wait a moment and refresh the page to try the query again.

## Solution for Root Cause 2

If the call chain span in your environment is lengthy, you can adjust the query time range for a single call chain using the `--es.asm.span-trace-query-time-adjustment-hours` startup parameter in `jaeger-query`.

The default value of this parameter is `1` hour, and you can increase this value as needed.
