# Introduction

The Distributed Tracing module is a core component of the ACP platform's observability suite that provides end-to-end request tracking and analysis capabilities for distributed microservices architectures.

This module delivers four essential tracing capabilities:

- **Trace collection** for automated gathering of distributed request data through OpenTelemetry automatic injection or SDK integration
- **Trace storage** for scalable persistence of tracing data using Elasticsearch as the backend storage
- **Trace visualization** for multi-dimensional analysis through customized UI dashboards and service dependency mapping
- **Trace querying** for precise search and filtering using TraceID, service names, tags, and other rich search conditions

By integrating these capabilities with OpenTelemetry standards and open-source components, it enables organizations to quickly locate service anomalies, analyze performance bottlenecks, trace complete request lifecycles, and optimize distributed system performance across their microservices architecture.

## Usage Limitations

When using tracing, the following constraints should be noted:

- **Balancing Sampling Strategies and Performance**
  - In high-load scenarios, the collection of tracing data may exert certain pressure on Elasticsearch's performance and storage; it is recommended to configure the sampling rate reasonably based on business conditions.
