# Non-Intrusive Integration of Call Tracing in Java Applications

:::info

The automatically injected [OpenTelemetry Java Agent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation) supports `Java 8+` versions.

:::

## Feature Overview

Call tracing is a core capability of observability in distributed systems, which can fully record the call paths and performance data of requests within the system. This article describes how to achieve non-intrusive integration of call tracing in Java applications using the automatic injection of the OpenTelemetry Java Agent.

## Use Cases

Java applications can be integrated for the following scenarios:

- Quickly adding call tracing capabilities to Java applications
- Avoiding modifications to the application source code
- Deploying services with Kubernetes
- Visualizing service inter-call relationships and analyzing performance bottlenecks

## Prerequisites

Before using this feature, ensure that:

- The target service is deployed on the Alauda Container Platform
- The service is using JDK version Java 8 or higher
- You have editing permissions for the Deployment in the target namespace
- The platform has completed [call tracing deployment](../installation.mdx)

## Steps to Operate

For a Java application that needs to be integrated into the Alauda Container Platform call tracing, the following adaptations are required:

- Configure automatic injection annotations for the Java Deployment.
- Set the `SERVICE_NAME` environment variable.
- Set the `SERVICE_NAMESPACE` environment variable.

Example of Deployment adaptation:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-java-deploy
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: cpaas-system/acp-common-java  # [!code callout]
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: my-java-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: SERVICE_NAME  # [!code callout]
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              apiVersion: v1
              fieldPath: metadata.labels['app.kubernetes.io/name']
        - name: SERVICE_NAMESPACE  # [!code callout]
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              apiVersion: v1
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
```

<Callouts>
  1. Choose `cpaas-system/acp-common-java` Instrumentation as the configuration for injecting the Java Agent.
  2. Configure the `SERVICE_NAME` environment variable, which can be associated through labels or fixed values.
  3. Configure the `SERVICE_NAMESPACE` environment variable, with its value as `metadata.namespace`.
</Callouts>

## Operation Results

After adapting the Java application:

- If the newly started Java application pod contains the `opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation-java` init container, it indicates that the injection was successful.
- Send test requests to the Java application.
- In the **Container Platform** view, select the **project**, **cluster**, and **namespace** where the Java application resides.
- Navigate to the **Observability** -> **Call Tracing** page to view the call tracing data and timeline waterfall diagram of the Java application.
