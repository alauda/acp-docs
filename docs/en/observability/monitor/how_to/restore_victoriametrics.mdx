# VictoriaMetrics Backup and Recovery of Monitoring Data

## Function Overview

The backup and recovery feature for VictoriaMetrics monitoring data allows you to perform regular backups of monitoring data and recover data when necessary, ensuring the safety and availability of monitoring data.

## Use Cases

- Regularly backing up monitoring data to prevent data loss
- Data migration during system migration
- Disaster recovery
- Reconstructing test environment data

## Prerequisites

- The ACP Monitoring with VictoriaMetrics plugin has been installed in the cluster
- Ensure there is sufficient storage space for backups
- Have access to the VictoriaMetrics storage path

## Procedures

### 1. Confirm Storage Path

The monitoring data of VictoriaMetrics is stored in the specified path of the container, which is indicated by the `-storageDataPath` parameter, defaulting to `/vm-data`.

Configuration example:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - args:
            - '-storageDataPath=/vm-data'
```

**Note**: The name of the computing component in the ACP Monitoring with VictoriaMetrics plugin is `vmstorage-cluster`, and its type is `StatefulSet`.

### 2. Execute Data Backup

Use vmbackup tool to perform data backup; please refer to the [vmbackup official documentation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmbackup.html) for detailed operations.

### 3. Execute Data Recovery

Use vmrestore tool to restore backup data; please refer to the [vmrestore official documentation](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmrestore.html) for detailed operations.

## Operation Result

After completing the backup, you will receive a complete backup file of the monitoring data. After executing the recovery operation, your monitoring data will be restored to the state it was in at the time of backup.
