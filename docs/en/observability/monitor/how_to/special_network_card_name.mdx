# Collect Network Data from Custom-Named Network Interfaces

## Function Overview

The platform supports collecting network data from custom-named network interfaces by modifying the configuration of the monitoring component, enabling you to view the network traffic information for these interfaces on the monitoring page.

## Use Case

This is applicable when your business nodes use custom-named network interfaces (not following the `eth.|en.|wl.*|ww.*` naming conventions) and require monitoring of these interfaces' network traffic data in the platform.

## Prerequisites

- A business cluster has been created
- You have platform administrator permissions
- The naming conventions for the custom network interfaces are known

## Procedures to Operate

1. Click the CLI tool icon in the top navigation bar of the platform.

2. Click **global**.

3. In the `global` cluster, find the moduleinfo resource name corresponding to your business cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl get moduleinfo | grep -E 'prometheus|victoriametrics'
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   global-6448ef7f7e5e3924c1629fad826372e7     global     prometheus          prometheus                          Running   v3.15.0-zz231204040711-9d1fc12474c2   v3.15.0-zz231204040711-9d1fc12474c2   v3.15.0-zz231204040711-9d1fc12474c2
   ovn-0954f21f0359720e8c115804376b3e7e        ovn        prometheus          prometheus                          Running   v3.15.0-zz231204040711-9d1fc12474c2   v3.15.0-zz231204040711-9d1fc12474c2   v3.15.0-zz231204040711-9d1fc12474c2
   ```

4. Edit the moduleinfo resource of the business cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl edit moduleinfo <moduleinfo resource name of the business cluster>
   ```

5. Add or modify the valuesOverride field:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     valuesOverride:# If this field does not exist, you need to add the valuesOverride field under spec along with the parameters below
       ait/chart-cpaas-monitor:
         global: 
           indicator:
             networkDevice: eth.*|em.*|en.*|wl.*|ww.*|[A-Z].*i|custom_interface # Replace custom_interface with the custom regular expression to ensure correct matching of the network interface name
   ```

6. After waiting for 10 minutes, check the network-related charts on the node's monitoring page to ensure the changes have taken effect.

## Operation Results

Once the configuration is effective, you can view the following data of the custom-named network interfaces on the platform's monitoring page:

- Network traffic data
- Network throughput
- Network packet statistics

## Learn More

- For more information on network monitoring, please refer to the [Monitoring Architecture Documentation](../architecture/index.mdx)

## Subsequent Actions

- Monitor the performance metrics of the custom network interfaces
- Set alert rules based on the monitoring data
