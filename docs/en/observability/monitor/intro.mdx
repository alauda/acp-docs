# Introduction

The Monitoring module is a core component of the ACP platform's observability suite that provides comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities for platform administrators and operations teams.

This module delivers four essential monitoring capabilities:

- **Metrics collection** for real-time performance data gathering from clusters, nodes, applications, and containers
- **Dashboards** for intuitive visualization and analysis of system health and performance trends
- **Alerting** for proactive detection of issues through customizable rules and thresholds
- **Notifications** for timely delivery of alert information to operations personnel

By integrating these capabilities with open-source components like Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, it enables organizations to maintain system reliability, prevent downtime, reduce operational costs, and ensure optimal performance across their entire infrastructure.
