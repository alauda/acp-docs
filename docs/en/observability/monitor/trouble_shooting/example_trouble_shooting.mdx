Introduce common problems users might encounter and their solutions. If the content is limited, include it directly on the "Problem Handling" single page. If the content is extensive, treat "Problem Handling" as a directory, with each issue as a separate document.

You can access the [problem handling document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) to see an example of the corresponding document.

# \<Title: Usually the Name of the Problem>

## Problem Description

Provide a detailed explanation of the environment in which the problem occurs, its impact scope, and the symptoms of the problem. Additionally, include the following supporting information as appropriate:

- Problem screenshots: Currently, it is recommended to use textual descriptions. If text cannot adequately describe the issue, screenshots should be used, and users need to register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Relevant logs: Include error messages, system logs, debug information, etc., in a code block format.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to this problem (these can be either a single confirmed cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause should meet the following conditions:

1. It must be an actual cause that has been confirmed to lead to this problem, rather than a speculative or imagined reason.
2. A detailed causal analysis should be provided, including:
   - How this cause triggers the problem.
   - The specific mechanism and process by which the problem occurs.

## Troubleshooting (Optional)

List the specific steps for troubleshooting the issue in detail. By troubleshooting, users can identify the most likely or certain cause among multiple possibilities and use appropriate solutions to resolve the problem. Troubleshooting should note:

- If there is only one root cause, then troubleshooting steps need to be provided. It is recommended to present them in a numbered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes and the troubleshooting steps differ, use a third-level header to list each root cause, and under each root cause, provide detailed troubleshooting steps.
  
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be "Solution")

Specific considerations, prerequisites, and steps to resolve the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level title name should be "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes and each has a different solution, each solution should be presented under a separate second-level title, titled "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," and so on.

### Considerations (Optional)

Points to note before starting operations. Failure to read this section carefully may lead to operation failures or even more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that need to be met before starting operational steps.

### Operational Steps (This third-level title can be omitted if there are no considerations or prerequisites)

- Operational steps are generally presented in a numbered list format; if the steps are complicated, additional headings can be used to separate sections, and a fourth-level header can be employed for each step, with detailed steps listed under each using a numbered list.
- If operations are being conducted on a container platform, each operational step can be fully detailed. If operations are on a third-party platform or other software, only key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: Non-container platform operations, if written too detailed, may not guarantee timely updates to the documentation as the interface changes, which could lead to many issues. To ensure the long-term usability of the documentation, steps for third-party platform operations should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Highlight core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose of the operations and the basic processes.

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be removed)

This part of the content should mirror the format of the solution for Root Cause 1 and will not be elaborated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the recurrence of this problem (suggestions, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can contain content used in the document, but which is inconvenient to include directly in the body, such as usage instructions for tools, reference materials, etc.
