# Monitoring Component Selection Guide

When installing cluster monitoring, the platform provides two monitoring components for you to choose from: VictoriaMetrics and Prometheus. This article will detail the characteristics and applicable scenarios of these two components, helping you make the most suitable choice.

## Important Notes

- Only one of VictoriaMetrics or Prometheus can be selected when installing cluster monitoring components.
- Starting from version 3.18, VictoriaMetrics has been upgraded to Beta status, which meets production environment usage conditions.
- VictoriaMetrics is suitable for scenarios with high availability requirements and multi-cluster monitoring.
- Prometheus is suitable for single-cluster monitoring scenarios, especially for smaller scales.

## Component List

### Prometheus Related Components

| Component Name          | Function Description                          |

| Prometheus Server       | Core server responsible for collecting, storing, and querying monitoring data |
| Exporters               | Monitoring data collection components that expose monitoring metrics via HTTP interfaces |
| AlertManager            | Alert management center, handling alert rules and notifications              |
| PushGateway             | Supports push mode for monitoring data, used for data transfer in special network environments |

### VictoriaMetrics Related Components

| Component Name          | Function Description                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| VMStorage               | Monitoring data storage engine            |
| VMInsert                | Data writing component responsible for data distribution and storage |
| VMSelect                | Query service component providing data querying capabilities |
| VMAlert                 | Alert rule evaluation and handling component |
| VMAgent                 | Monitoring metric collection component     |

## Architecture Comparison

### Prometheus Architecture

Prometheus is a mature open-source monitoring system and is the second graduated project of CNCF after Kubernetes. It has the following characteristics:

- Powerful data collection capabilities.
- Flexible query language PromQL.
- A comprehensive ecosystem.
- Supports cluster monitoring at a thousand-node scale.

### VictoriaMetrics Architecture

VictoriaMetrics is a next-generation high-performance time series database and monitoring solution with the following advantages:

- Higher data compression ratio.
- Lower resource consumption.
- Native support for cluster high availability.
- Simpler operation and maintenance management.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature               | Prometheus | VictoriaMetrics | Description                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| High Availability Installation | ❌          | ✅               | VictoriaMetrics supports true cluster high availability with better data consistency |
| Single Node Installation | ✅          | ✅               | Both support single-node installation mode                      |
| Long-term Data Storage  | Requires remote storage | Natively supported | VictoriaMetrics is more suitable for long-term data storage |
| Resource Efficiency     | Higher      | Better           | VictoriaMetrics has better resource utilization               |
| Community Support       | Very mature | Rapidly developing | Prometheus has a larger community ecosystem                  |

## Installation Scheme Suggestions

### Monitoring Installation Architecture Overview

![](../assets/vm_prometheus_flow.png)

The above diagram shows the installation architecture and data flow of the monitoring components supported by the platform. The platform provides the following two installation methods for selection:

**Note**: When replacing monitoring components, please ensure that existing components are completely uninstalled, and monitoring data does not support cross-component migration.

#### Prometheus Installation Method

This method corresponds to the architecture of **cluster4** in the above diagram:

- Uses Prometheus components to collect and process monitoring data.
- Queries and displays data through the monitoring panel.
- Suitable for single-cluster scenarios.

#### VictoriaMetrics Installation Method

VictoriaMetrics supports the following two installation modes:

1. **Single Cluster Installation Mode**
   - Corresponds to the architecture of **cluster2** in the above diagram.
   - All VictoriaMetrics components are installed in the same cluster.
   - Uses VMAgent to collect data and write to VictoriaMetrics.
   - VMAlert is responsible for alert rule evaluation.
   - Queries and displays data through the monitoring panel.
   **Tip**: It is recommended to use this mode when data scale is below 1 million per second.

2. **Multi-Cluster Installation Mode**
   - Corresponds to the architecture of **cluster1/cluster2/cluster3** in the above diagram.
   - Installs VMAgent in the workload cluster as a data collection agent.
   - VMAgent writes data into VictoriaMetrics in the central monitoring cluster.
   - Supports unified monitoring management across multiple clusters.
   **Tip**: Ensure that VictoriaMetrics services are installed in the monitoring cluster before installing VMAgent.

### Selection Recommendations

#### Scenarios Suitable for Using VictoriaMetrics

- **High Performance and Scalability Needs**: Suitable for monitoring scenarios that handle high-throughput data and long-term storage.
- **Cost-Effectiveness Considerations**: Need to optimize storage and computing resource costs.
- **High Availability Requirements**: Requires high availability assurance for monitoring components.
- **Multi-Cluster Management**: Requires unified management of monitoring data across multiple clusters.

#### Scenarios Suitable for Using Prometheus

- **Single Cluster with Small Scale**: Monitoring scale is small, with no high availability requirements.
- **Existing Prometheus Users**: Already have a complete Prometheus monitoring system.
- **Simple Stability Requirements**: Pursuing a simple and reliable monitoring solution.
- **Deep Ecosystem Integration**: Closely integrated with the Prometheus ecosystem, with high migration costs.
