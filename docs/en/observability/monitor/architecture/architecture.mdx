# Monitoring Module Architecture

![](../assets/visio_for_monitor.png)

## Overall Architecture Explanation

The monitoring system consists of the following core functional modules:

1. Monitoring System
   - Data Collection and Storage: Collecting and persisting monitoring metrics from multiple sources
   - Data Query and Visualization: Providing flexible query and visualization capabilities for monitoring data
2. Alerting System
   - Alert Rule Management: Configuring and managing alert policies
   - Alert Triggering and Notification: Evaluating alert rules and dispatching notifications
   - Real-time Alert Status: Providing a real-time view of the current alert status of the system
3. Notification System
   - Notification Configuration: Managing notification templates, contact groups, and policies
   - Notification Server: Managing the configuration of various notification channels

## Monitoring System

### Data Collection and Storage

1. Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics Operator Responsibilities:
   - Load and validate monitoring collection configurations
   - Load and validate alert rule configurations
   - Synchronize configurations to Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics instances
2. Sources of Monitoring Data:
   - Nevermore: Generates log-related metrics
   - Warlock: Generates event-related metrics
   - Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics: Discovers and collects various exporters' metrics via ServiceMonitor

### Data Query and Visualization

1. Monitoring Data Query Process:
   - The browser initiates a query request (Path: `/platform/monitoring.alauda.io/v1beta1`)
   - ALB forwards the request to the Courier component
   - Courier API processes the query:
     - Built-in Metrics: Obtains PromQL through the indicators interface and queries
     - Custom Metrics: Directly forwards PromQL to the monitoring component
   - The monitoring dashboard retrieves data and displays it

2. Monitoring Dashboard Management Process:
   - Users access the Global cluster ALB (Path: `/kubernetes/cluster_name/apis/ait.alauda.io/v1alpha2/MonitorDashboard`)
   - ALB forwards the request to the Erebus component
   - Erebus routes the request to the target monitoring cluster
   - The Warlock component is responsible for:
     - Validating the legality of the monitoring dashboard configuration
     - Managing the MonitorDashboard CR resource

## Alerting System

### Alert Rule Management

The alert rule configuration process:

1. Users access the Global cluster ALB (Path: `/kubernetes/cluster_name/apis/monitoring.coreos.com/v1/prometheusrules`)
2. The request passes through ALB -> Erebus -> target cluster kube-apiserver
3. Responsibilities of each component:
   - Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics Operator:
     - Validating the legality of alert rules
     - Managing PrometheusRule CR
   - Nevermore: Listening for and processing log alert metrics
   - Warlock: Listening for and processing event alert metrics

### Alert Processing Workflow

1. Alert Evaluation:
   - PrometheusRule/VMRule defines alert rules
   - Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics evaluates rules periodically
2. Alert Notification:
   - Alerts are sent to Alertmanager once triggered
   - Alertmanager -> ALB -> Courier API
   - Courier API is responsible for dispatching notifications
3. Alert Storage:
   - Alert history is stored in ElasticSearch/ClickHouse

### Real-time Alert Status

1. Status Collection:
   - The Global cluster Courier generates metrics:
     - cpaas_active_alerts: Current active alerts
     - cpaas_active_silences: Current silence configurations
   - Global Prometheus collects every 15 seconds
2. Status Display:
   - The front-end queries and displays real-time status via Courier API

## Notification System

### Notification Configuration Management

The management process for notification templates, notification contact groups, and notification policies is as follows:

1. Users access the standard API of the Global cluster via a browser
   - Access path: `/apis/ait.alauda.io/v1beta1/namespaces/cpaas-system`
2. Managing related resources:
   - Notification Template: apiVersion: "ait.alauda.io/v1beta1", kind: "NotificationTemplate"
   - Notification Contact Group: apiVersion: "ait.alauda.io/v1beta1", kind: "NotificationGroup"
   - Notification Policy: apiVersion: "ait.alauda.io/v1beta1", kind: "Notification"
3. Courier is responsible for:
   - Validating the legality of notification templates
   - Validating the legality of notification contact groups
   - Validating the legality of notification policies

### Notification Server Management

1. Users access the Global cluster's ALB via a browser
   - Access path: `/kubernetes/global/api/v1/namespaces/cpaas-system/secrets`
2. Managing and submitting notification server configurations
   - Resource name: platform-email-server
3. Courier is responsible for:
   - Validating the legality of the notification server configuration
