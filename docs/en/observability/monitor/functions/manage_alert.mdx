## Creating Alarm Policies via UI {#alert_ui}

### Prerequisites

- A notification policy is configured (if you need to configure automatic alarm notifications).
- Monitoring components are deployed in the target cluster (required when creating alarm policies using monitoring indicators).
- Log storage components and log collection components are deployed in the target cluster (required when creating alarm policies using logs and events).

### Steps

1. Navigate to **Operation and Maintenance Center** > **Alarms** > **Alarm Policies**.
2. Click **Create Alarm Policy**.
3. Configure basic information.

#### Selecting Alarm Type

**Resource Alarm**

- Alarm types categorized by resource type (e.g., deployment status under a namespace).
- Resource selection description:
  - Defaults to "Any" if no parameter is selected, supporting automatic association with newly added resources.
  - When "Select All" is chosen, it only applies to the current resource.
  - When multiple namespaces are selected, resource names support regular expressions (e.g., `cert.*`).

**Event Alarm**

- Alarm types categorized by specific events (e.g., abnormal Pod status).
- By default, selects all resources under the specified resource and supports automatic association with newly added resources.

#### Configuring Alarm Rules

Click **Add Alarm Rule** and configure the following parameters based on the alarm type:

**Resource Alarm Parameters**

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expression | Monitoring metric algorithm in Prometheus format, e.g., `rate(node_network_receive_bytes{instance="$server",device!~"lo"}[5m])` |
| Metric Unit | Custom monitoring metric unit, can be entered manually or selected from platform preset units                                                  |
| Legend Parameter | Controls the name corresponding to the curve in the chart, formatted as `{{.LabelName}}`, e.g., `{{.hostname}}`                           |
| Time Range | Time window for log/event queries                                                                           |
| Log Content | Query fields for log content (e.g., Error), where multiple query fields are linked by OR                                 |
| Event Reason | Query fields for event reasons (Reason, e.g., BackOff, Pulling, Failed, etc.), where multiple query fields are linked by OR  |
| Trigger Condition | Condition consisting of comparison operators, alarm thresholds, and duration (optional). Determines if an alarm is triggered based on the comparison of real-time values/log count/event count against the alarm threshold, as well as the duration of real-time values within the alarm threshold range. |
| Alarm Level | Divided into four levels: Critical, Serious, Warning, and Info. You can set a reasonable alarm level according to the impact of the alarm rules on business for the corresponding resources. |

**Event Alarm Parameters**

| Parameter    | Description                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Time Range   | Time window for event queries     |
| Event Monitoring Item | Supports monitoring event levels or event reasons, where multiple fields are linked by OR |
| Trigger Condition | Based on event count for comparison judgement       |
| Alarm Level  | Same definition as resource alarm levels |

#### Other Configurations

1. Select one or more created notification policies.
2. Configure alarm sending intervals.
   - Global: Use platform default configuration.
   - Custom: Different sending intervals can be set based on alarm levels.
   - When "Do Not Repeat" is selected, notifications will only be sent when the alarm is triggered and recovered.

### Additional Notes

1. In the "More" options of the alarm rule, labels and annotations can be set.
2. Please refer to the [Prometheus Alerting Rules Documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) for configuring labels and annotations.
3. Note: Do not use the `$value` variable in labels, as this may cause alarm exceptions.

## Creating Alarm Policies via Alarm Templates

Alarm templates are a combination of alarm rules and notification policies targeted at similar resources. Through alarm templates, it is easy and quick to create alarm policies for clusters, nodes, or computing components on the platform.

### Prerequisites

- A notification policy is configured (if you need to configure automatic alarm notifications).
- Monitoring components are deployed in the target cluster (required when creating alarm policies using monitoring indicators).

### Steps

#### Creating Alarm Template

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Operation and Maintenance Center** > **Alarms** > **Alarm Templates**.
2. Click **Create Alarm Template**.
3. Configure the basic information of the alarm template.
4. In the **Alarm Rules** section, click **Add Alarm Rule**, and follow the parameter descriptions below to add alarm rules:

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expression | Monitoring metric algorithm in Prometheus format, e.g., `rate(node_network_receive_bytes{instance="$server",device!~"lo"}[5m])` |
| Metric Unit | Custom monitoring metric unit, can be entered manually or selected from platform preset units                                                  |
| Legend Parameter | Controls the name corresponding to the curve in the chart, formatted as `{{.LabelName}}`, e.g., `{{.hostname}}`                           |
| Time Range | Time window for log/event queries                                                                           |
| Log Content | Query fields for log content (e.g., Error), where multiple query fields are linked by OR                                 |
| Event Reason | Query fields for event reasons (Reason, e.g., BackOff, Pulling, Failed, etc.), where multiple query fields are linked by OR  |
| Trigger Condition | Condition consisting of comparison operators, alarm thresholds, and duration (optional).                                                                    |
| Alarm Level | Divided into four levels: Critical, Serious, Warning, and Info. You can set a reasonable alarm level according to the impact of the alarm rules on business for the corresponding resources. |

5. Click **Create**.

#### Creating Alarm Policies Using Alarm Templates

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Operation and Maintenance Center** > **Alarms** > **Alarm Policies**.
   **Tip**: You can switch the target cluster through the top navigation bar.
2. Click the expand button next to the **Create Alarm Policy** button > **Template Create Alarm Policy**.
3. Configure some parameters, referring to the descriptions below:

| Parameter      | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Template Name** | The name of the alarm template to use. The templates are categorized by cluster, node, and computing component. Upon selecting a template, you can view the alarm rules, notification policies, and other information set within the alarm template. |
| **Resource Type** | Select whether the template is an alarm policy template for **Cluster**, **Node**, or **Computing Component**; the corresponding resource name will be displayed.      |

4. Click **Create**.

## Setting Silence for Alarms

Supports silencing alarms for clusters, nodes, and computing components. By setting silence for specific alarm policies, you can control that all rules under the alarm policy do not send notification messages when triggered during the set silence period. Permanent silence and custom time silence can be set.

For example: When the platform is upgraded or maintained, many resources may show abnormal statuses, leading to numerous triggered alarms, which cause operation and maintenance personnel to frequently receive alarm notifications before the upgrade or maintenance is completed. Setting silence for the alarm policy can prevent this situation.

**Note**: When the silence status persists until the silence end time, the silence setting will be automatically cleared.

### Setting via UI

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Operation and Maintenance Center** > **Alarms** > **Alarm Policies**.

2. Click the operation button on the right side of the alarm policy to be silenced > **Set Silence**.

3. Toggle **Alarm Silence** switch to open it.

   **Tip**: This switch controls whether the silence setting takes effect. To cancel silence, simply turn off the switch.

4. Configure relevant parameters according to the descriptions below:

   **Tip**: If no silence range or resource name is selected, it defaults to **Any**, meaning that subsequent **Delete/Add** resource actions will correspond to **Delete Silence/Add Silence** alarm policies; if "Select All" is chosen, it will only apply to the currently selected resource range, and subsequent **Delete/Add** resource actions will not be processed.

   | Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                            |
   | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Silence Range** | The scope of resources where the silence setting takes effect.                                                                        |
   | **Resource Name** | The name of the resource object targeted by the silence setting.                                                                       |
   | **Silence Time**  | The time range for alarm silence. The alarm will enter silence state at the start of the silence time, and if the alarm policy remains in an alarm state or triggers alarms after the silence end time, alarm notifications will resume. **Permanent**: The silence setting will last until the alarm policy is deleted. **Custom**: Custom settings for the start time and end time of silence, with the time interval not less than 5 minutes. |

5. Click **Set**.

   **Tip**: From the moment silence is set until the start of silence, the silence status of the alarm policy is considered **Silence Waiting**. During this period, when rules in the policy trigger alarms, notifications will be sent normally; after silence starts until it ends, the silence status of the alarm policy is **Silencing**, and when rules in the policy trigger alarms, notifications will not be sent.

### Setting via CLI

1. Specify the resource name of the alarm policy you want to set silence for and execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl edit PrometheusRule <TheNameOfTheAlarmPolicyYouWantToSet>
```

2. Modify the resource as shown in the example to add silence annotations and submit.

```yaml

## Recommendations for Configuring Alarm Rules

More alarm rules do not always equate to better outcomes. Redundant or complex alarm rules can lead to alarm storms and increase your maintenance burden. It is recommended that you read the following guidelines before configuring alarm rules to ensure that custom rules can achieve their intended purposes while remaining efficient.

- **Use the Fewest New Rules Possible**: Create only those rules that meet your specific requirements. By using the fewest number of rules, you can create a more manageable and centralized alert system in the monitoring environment.
- **Focus on Symptoms Rather than Causes**: Create rules that notify users of symptoms rather than the root causes of those symptoms. This ensures that when relevant symptoms occur, users can receive alerts and may investigate the root causes that triggered the alerts. Using this strategy can significantly reduce the total number of rules you need to create.
- **Plan and Assess Your Needs Before Making Changes**: First, clarify which symptoms are important and what actions you want users to take when these symptoms occur. Then evaluate existing rules to decide if you can modify them to achieve your objectives without creating new rules for each symptom. By modifying existing rules and carefully creating new ones, you can help simplify the alert system.
- **Provide Clear Alert Messages**: When you create alert messages, include descriptions of symptoms, possible causes, and recommended actions. The information included should be clear, concise, and provide troubleshooting steps or links to additional relevant information. Doing so helps users quickly assess situations and respond appropriately.
- **Set Severity Levels Reasonably**: Assign severity levels to your rules to indicate how users should respond when symptoms trigger alerts. For instance, classify alerts with a severity level of Critical, signaling that immediate action is required from relevant personnel. By establishing severity levels, you can help users decide how to respond upon receiving alerts and ensure prompt responses to urgent issues.
