# Management Metrics

The platform's monitoring system is based on the metrics collected by Prometheus / VictoriaMetrics. This document will guide you on how to manage these metrics.

## Viewing Metrics Exposed by Platform Components

The monitoring method for the cluster components within the platform is to extract metrics exposed via `ServiceMonitor`. Metrics in the platform are publicly available through the `/metrics` endpoint. You can view the exposed metrics of a specific component in the platform using the following example command:

```bash
curl -s http://<Component IP>:<Component metrics port>/metrics | grep 'TYPE\|HELP'
```

Sample Output:

```bash
# HELP controller_runtime_active_workers Number of currently used workers per controller
# TYPE controller_runtime_active_workers gauge
# HELP controller_runtime_max_concurrent_reconciles Maximum number of concurrent reconciles per controller
# TYPE controller_runtime_max_concurrent_reconciles gauge
# HELP controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total Total number of reconciliation errors per controller
# TYPE controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total counter
# HELP controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds Length of time per reconciliation per controller
```

## Viewing All Metrics Stored by Prometheus / VictoriaMetrics

You can view the list of available metrics in the cluster to help you write the PromQL you need based on these metrics.

### Prerequisites

1. You have obtained your user Token

2. You have obtained the platform address

### Steps

<Steps>
  Run the following command to get the list of metrics using the `curl` command:

  ```bash
  curl -k -X 'GET' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Your token>' 'https://<Your platform access address>/v2/metrics/<Your cluster name>/prometheus/label/__name__/values'
  ```

  Sample Output:

  ```bash
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": [
      "ALERTS",
    "ALERTS_FOR_STATE",
    "advanced_search_cached_resources_count",
    "alb_error",
    "alertmanager_alerts",
    "alertmanager_alerts_invalid_total",
    "alertmanager_alerts_received_total",
    "alertmanager_cluster_enabled"]
  }
  ```
</Steps>

## Viewing All Built-in Metrics Defined by the Platform

To simplify user usage, the platform has built in a large number of commonly used metrics. You can directly use these metrics when configuring alerts or monitoring dashboards without needing to define them yourself. The following will introduce you to how to view these metrics.

### Prerequisites

1. You have obtained your user Token

2. You have obtained the platform address

### Steps

<Steps>
  Run the following command to get the list of metrics using the `curl` command:

  ```bash
  curl -k -X 'GET' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Your token>' 'https://<Your platform access address>/v2/metrics/<Your cluster name>/indicators'
  ```

  Sample Output:

  ```bash
  [
    {
    "alertEnabled": true, # [!code callout]
    "annotations": {
     "cn": "CPU utilization of containers in the compute component",
     "descriptionEN": "Cpu utilization for pods in workload",
     "descriptionZH": "CPU utilization of containers in the compute component",
     "displayNameEN": "CPU utilization of the pods",
     "displayNameZH": "CPU utilization of containers in the compute component",
     "en": "Cpu utilization for pods in workload",
     "features": "SupportDashboard", # [!code callout]
     "summaryEN": "CPU usage rate {{.externalLabels.comparison}}{{.externalLabels.threshold}} of Pod ({{.labels.pod}})",
     "summaryZH": "CPU usage rate {{.externalLabels.comparison}}{{.externalLabels.threshold}} of pod ({{.labels.pod}})"
    },
    "displayName": "CPU utilization of containers in the compute component",
    "kind": "workload",
    "multipleEnabled": true,  # [!code callout] 
    "name": "workload.pod.cpu.utilization",
    "query": "avg by (kind,name,namespace,pod) (avg by (kind,name,namespace,pod,container)(cpaas_advanced_container_cpu_usage_seconds_total_irate5m{kind=~\"{{.kind}}\",name=~\"{{.name}}\",namespace=~\"{{.namespace}}\",container!=\"\",container!=\"POD\"}) / avg by (kind,name,namespace,pod,container)(cpaas_advanced_kube_pod_container_resource_limits{kind=~\"{{.kind}}\",name=~\"{{.name}}\",namespace=~\"{{.namespace}}\",resource=\"cpu\"}))", # [!code callout]
    "summary": "CPU usage rate {{.externalLabels.comparison}}{{.externalLabels.threshold}} of pod ({{.labels.pod}})",
    "type": "metric",
    "unit": "%",
    "legend": "{{.namespace}}/{{.pod}}",
    "variables": [ # [!code callout] 
     "namespace",
     "name",
     "kind"
    ]
   }
  ]

  ```

  <Callouts>
    1. Whether this metric supports being used for configuring alerts
    2. Whether this metric supports being used in monitoring dashboards
    3. Whether this metric supports being used when configuring alerts for multiple resources
    4. The PromQL statement defined for the metric
    5. The variables that can be used in the PromQL statement of the metric
  </Callouts>
</Steps>

## Integrating External Metrics

In addition to the built-in metrics of the platform, you can also integrate metrics exposed by your applications or third-party applications via `ServiceMonitor` or `PodMonitor`. This section uses the Elasticsearch Exporter installed in pod form in the same cluster as an example for explanation.

### Prerequisites

You have installed your application and exposed metrics through specified interfaces. In this document, we assume your application is installed in the `cpaas-system` namespace and has exposed the `http://<elasticsearch-exporter-ip>:9200/_prometheus/metrics` endpoint.

### Steps

<Steps>
  1. Create a Service/Endpoint for the Exporter to expose metrics

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    labels:
      chart: elasticsearch
      service_name: cpaas-elasticsearch
    name: cpaas-elasticsearch
    namespace: cpaas-system
  spec:
    clusterIP: 10.105.125.99
    ports:
    - name: cpaas-elasticsearch
      port: 9200
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 9200
    selector:
      service_name: cpaas-elasticsearch
    sessionAffinity: None
    type: ClusterIP
  ```

  2. Create a `ServiceMonitor` object to describe the metrics exposed by your application:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
  kind: ServiceMonitor
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: cpaas-monitor
      chart: cpaas-monitor
      heritage: Helm
      prometheus: kube-prometheus            # [!code callout]
      release: cpaas-monitor
    name: cpaas-elasticsearch-Exporter
    namespace: cpaas-system                  # [!code callout]
  spec:
    jobLabel: service_name                   # [!code callout]
    namespaceSelector:                       # [!code callout]
      any: true
    selector:                                # [!code callout]
      matchExpressions:
      - key: service_name
        operator: Exists
    endpoints:
    - port: cpaas-elasticsearch              # [!code callout] 
      path: /_prometheus/metrics             # [!code callout] 
      interval: 60s                          # [!code callout] 
      honorLabels: true
      basicAuth:                             # [!code callout] 
        password:
          key: ES_PASSWORD
          name: acp-config-secret
        username:
          key: ES_USER
          name: acp-config-secret
  ```

  <Callouts>
    1. To which Prometheus should the ServiceMonitor be synchronized; the operator will listen to the corresponding ServiceMonitor resource based on the serviceMonitorSelector configuration of the Prometheus CR. If the ServiceMonitor’s labels do not match the serviceMonitorSelector configuration of the Prometheus CR, this ServiceMonitor will not be monitored by the operator.
    2. The operator will listen to which namespaces of ServiceMonitor based on the serviceMonitorNamespaceSelector configuration of the Prometheus CR; if the ServiceMonitor is not in the serviceMonitorNamespaceSelector of the Prometheus CR, this ServiceMonitor will not be monitored by the operator.
    3. Metrics collected by Prometheus will add a job label, with the value being the service label value corresponding to jobLabel.
    4. The ServiceMonitor matches the corresponding Service based on the namespaceSelector configuration.
    5. The ServiceMonitor matches the Service based on the selector configuration.
    6. The ServiceMonitor matches the Service’s port based on port configuration.
    7. The access path to the Exporter, default is /metrics.
    8. The interval at which Prometheus scrapes the Exporter metrics.
    9. If authentication is required to access the Exporter path, authentication information needs to be added; it also supports bearer token, tls authentication, and other methods.
  </Callouts>

  3. Check if the ServiceMonitor is being monitored by Prometheus

  Access the UI of the monitoring component to check if the job `cpaas-elasticsearch-exporter` exists.

  - Prometheus UI address: `https://<Your platform access address>/clusters/<Cluster name>/prometheus-0/targets`
  - VictoriaMetrics UI address: `https://<Your platform access address>/clusters/<Cluster name>/vmselect/vmui/?#/metrics`
</Steps>
