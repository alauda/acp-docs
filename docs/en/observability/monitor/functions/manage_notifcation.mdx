# Management Notification

## Feature Overview

With notifications, you can integrate the platform's monitoring and alerting features to promptly send pre-warning information to notification recipients, reminding relevant personnel to take necessary measures to resolve issues or avoid failures.

## Key Features

- **Notification Server**: The notification server provides services for sending notification messages to notification contact groups on the platform, such as an email server.
- **Notification Contact Group**: A notification contact group is a set of notification recipients with similar logical characteristics, which can reduce your maintenance burden by allowing a categorization of entities that receive notification messages.
- **Notification Template**: A notification template is a standardized structure composed of custom content, content variables, and content format parameters. It is used to standardize the content and format of alert notification messages for notification strategies. For example, customizing the subject and content of email notifications.
- **Notification rule**: A notification rule is a collection of rules defining how to send notification messages to specific contacts. It is essential to use a notification rule for scenarios such as alerts, inspections, and login authentication that require notifying external services.

## Notification Server

The notification server provides services for sending notification messages to recipients on the platform. The platform currently supports the following notification servers:

- **Corporate Communication Tool Server**: Supports integration with WeChat Work, DingTalk, and Feishu built-in applications for sending notifications to individuals.
- **Email Server**: Sends notifications via email using an email server.
- **Webhook Type Server**: Supports integration with corporate WeChat group bots, DingTalk group bots, Feishu group bots, or sending WebHooks to your designated server.

:::

6. Click **Create**.

### Reference Variables {#varibales}

Variables are the keys of labels or annotations in notification messages (NotificationMessage), formatted as `{{.labelKey}}`. To facilitate users in quickly obtaining key information, custom display names can be assigned to variables; for example: `Alert Level: {{ .externalLabels.severity }}`.

When a notification rule sends notification messages to users based on a notification template, the variables in the template will reference the corresponding label values in the notification message (actual monitoring data). Ultimately, monitoring data will be sent to users in a standardized content format.

The platform provides the following basic variables by default:

| Display Name     | Variable                                                                    | Description                                 |
