# Events

The platform integrates with Kubernetes events, recording significant state changes and various operational status changes of Kubernetes resources, while providing storage, query, and visualization capabilities. When anomalies occur with clusters, nodes, Pods, and other resources, the specific reasons can be analyzed through events.

Based on the reasons for the events, alarm policies can be [created](../../monitor/functions/manage_alert.mdx) for computing components. When the number of critical events reaches the alarm threshold, alerts can be automatically triggered to notify relevant personnel for timely handling, thereby reducing the operational risks of the platform business.

## Operation Steps

1. Click on **Operation Center** > **Events** in the left navigation bar.

   **Tip**: Use the cluster switch dropdown menu in the top navigation bar to change the cluster for viewing events.

## Event Overview

The events page displays an overview of important events and resource event records that occurred in the last 30 minutes by default (custom time range can be selected).

- **Overview of Important Events**: The card displays the reasons for important events and the number of resources that experienced such events within the queried time frame.
  - **Note**: The number of resources will not accumulate if the same resource experiences such events multiple times.

  - For example, if the count of resources for node restart events is 20, it indicates that within the queried time frame, 20 resources experienced this type of event, although the same resource may have occurred multiple times.
- **Resource Event Records**: Below the overview of important events, all event records that meet the query criteria for the selected time frame are displayed. You can filter the corresponding types of events by clicking on the important event card, or expand and enter query conditions for the search. The query conditions are explained as follows:

  - **Resource Type**: The type of Kubernetes resource that triggered the event, such as Pod.

  - **Namespace**: The namespace of the Kubernetes resource where the event occurred.

  - **Event Reason**: The reason for the occurrence of the event (reason).

  - **Event Level**: The importance level of the event, such as Warning.

  - **Resource Name**: The name of the Kubernetes resource where the event occurred. Supports selecting or entering multiple names.

:::tip

- Click the view icon to the right of the resource name in the event record to see detailed event information in the popup **Event Details** dialog.
- The color of the icon to the left of the event reason indicates the event level. A green icon signifies that the event level is `Normal`, and this event can be ignored; an orange icon indicates that the event level is `Warning`, which implies resource anomalies, necessitating attention to prevent potential failures.
