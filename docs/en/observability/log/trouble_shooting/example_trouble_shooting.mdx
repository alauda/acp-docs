Introduce common issues that users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is brief, it can be placed directly on a single page titled "Troubleshooting." If the content is lengthy, make "Troubleshooting" a directory, with each issue as a separate document.

You can refer to the [Troubleshooting Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) for corresponding document samples.

:::

# \<Title: Generally the name of the issue>

## Problem Description

Provide a detailed explanation of the environment where the problem occurs, its scope of impact, and the phenomena observed, and include the following auxiliary information as appropriate:

- Problem Screenshot: Currently, it is recommended to use text descriptions first; if the text cannot describe the issue, screenshots may be used. Users need to register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Relevant Logs: Include error messages, system logs, debugging information, etc., in the form of code blocks.

## Root Cause Analysis

List one or more actual causes that have led to the issue (it can be a singular verified cause or multiple potential causes). Each cause should meet the following criteria:

1. Must be an actual cause that has occurred and has been confirmed to lead to the issue, rather than speculative or imagined causes.
2. A detailed causal analysis must be provided, including:
   - How the cause triggers the issue.
   - The specific mechanism and process through which the issue occurs.

## Problem Investigation (Optional)

List the specific steps to investigate the issue in detail. Through the investigation, users can select the most likely or confirmed cause among multiple reasons and use suitable solutions to resolve the issue. When investigating the problem, note the following:

- If only one root cause exists, provide the investigation steps; it is recommended to present these steps in a numbered list format.

  ```
  1. Investigation Step 1
  ...
  n. Investigation Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different investigation steps, use third-level headings to list each root cause, and under each root cause, provide detailed investigation steps.
  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Investigation Step 1
    ...
    n. Investigation Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Investigation Step 1
    ...
    n. Investigation Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be "Solution.")

Specific notes, prerequisites, and operational steps to resolve the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the second-level title is "Solution"; if there are multiple root causes, and each root cause has different solutions, then each solution is separated with its own second-level title, such as "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," etc.

### Notes (Optional)

Things to be aware of before starting operations. If this section is not read carefully, it may lead to operational failure or even more serious consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that need to be met before starting the operational steps.

### Operational Steps (If there are no notes and prerequisites, this third-level title can be omitted)

- Operational steps are generally presented in a numbered list format. If the steps are complex, additional headings may be added between multiple steps for differentiation; in this case, fourth-level headings can be used to list each step, with specific steps detailed using a numbered list.
- If the operations are performed on a container platform, the detailed steps of each operation can be listed completely; if the operations are on third-party platforms or other software, only the key steps should be provided.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if described overly detailed, we cannot ensure that the document will be updated promptly when their interface changes, which may cause many problems. Thus, to ensure the document's long-term usability, the description of third-party platform operational steps should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Focus on key steps and critical operations.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain the generality and flexibility of operational step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose of operations and the basic process.

...

## Solution for Root Cause N (This is the title format for multiple root causes; if there is a single root cause, this second-level title should be removed.)

The content in this section is consistent with the solution for Root Cause 1, and will not be repeated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures to prevent the issue from reoccurring (suggestions, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.).

## Related Content (Optional)

This section can hold content that is referenced in the document but is not suitable for inclusion in the main text, such as tool usage methods, reference materials, etc.
