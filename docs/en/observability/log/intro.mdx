# Introduction

The Logging module is a core component of the ACP platform's observability suite that provides comprehensive log management capabilities for efficient and reliable log processing.

This module delivers four essential logging capabilities:

- **Log collection** for automated gathering of logs from applications, containers, and infrastructure components
- **Log storage** for scalable and durable persistence using ElasticSearch and ClickHouse backends
- **Log querying** for fast and flexible search across large volumes of log data

By integrating these capabilities with powerful open-source components like Filebeat, ElasticSearch, and ClickHouse, it enables organizations to efficiently handle massive log volumes, accelerate troubleshooting, ensure compliance requirements, and gain valuable operational insights in real time.
