# Introduction

## Module Overview

The logging module is an efficient and reliable log management solution provided by ACP, designed to offer users comprehensive log collection, storage, querying, and analysis capabilities. Based on powerful open-source components, the system utilizes Filebeat for log collection, and ElasticSearch and Clickhouse as log storage backends, ensuring users can easily handle large volumes of log data and obtain key business insights in real time.

## Module Advantages

- High Performance: With the robust performance of ElasticSearch and Clickhouse, the system can handle massive amounts of data and support fast querying and analysis.
- Flexibility: It supports the collection of various log sources, meeting the needs of different business scenarios.
- Real-time Capability: It provides real-time log processing capabilities, allowing users to quickly identify and respond to system failures or security incidents.
- Scalability: The system architecture is designed to support horizontal scaling, enabling easy resource expansion according to business growth.
- User-friendly: It offers a visual interface and simple query language, making it easy for users to get started.

## Module Use Cases

- System Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of application and server operating statuses, allowing for the timely detection and handling of anomalies.
- Security Auditing: Collecting and analyzing security logs to help enterprises identify potential security threats and violations.
- Fault Troubleshooting: Quickly locating the root cause of faults through log analysis, thus improving system recovery efficiency.
- Business Analysis: Assisting in decision-making and optimizing business processes through the analysis of user behavior and system performance logs.

## Module Usage Limitations

- Capacity Planning: Large-scale log data storage requires adequate resource planning; please assess your log scale in advance and prepare according to the [Capacity Planning](./architecture/capacity_planning.mdx) document.
- Port Access: If deploying log storage components in a business cluster, ensure that the global cluster can access port 11780 of the business cluster.
- Component Selection: The platform offers two different log storage components, ElasticSearch and Clickhouse; please make your component selection based on your needs in advance.
- Deployment Planning: The platform supports the deployment of log storage components in any cluster; logs from any cluster can be collected in advance to the log storage components of a designated cluster. Please plan the deployment of log-related components based on your data center layout to avoid excessive bandwidth costs due to cross-domain traffic.
