# Overview

The Observability module is a core feature of the ACP platform that provides comprehensive monitoring and observability capabilities for cloud-native applications.

This module integrates four essential observability pillars:

- **Synthetic monitoring (probe)** for proactive endpoint testing
- **Centralized logging** for unified log management and analysis  
- **Real-time monitoring** for metrics collection and alerting
- **Distributed tracing** for end-to-end request tracking across microservices

By combining these capabilities into a single platform, it enables organizations to achieve complete visibility into application performance, rapidly diagnose issues, ensure system reliability, and optimize user experience across their entire technology stack.
