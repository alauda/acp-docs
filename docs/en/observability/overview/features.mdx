# Function Overview

## Monitoring

- **Dial Test**

  The platform provides dial testing (black-box monitoring) capabilities based on the Blackbox Exporter, supporting probes of network services through various protocols such as ICMP, TCP, and HTTP. Unlike white-box monitoring, which focuses on the internal state of the system, black-box monitoring probes services from the user's perspective, enabling quick detection of various failures that affect user experience.

  For instance, when a business interface responds abnormally or when a service is unavailable, black-box monitoring can promptly discover the issue and trigger alerts to assist operations personnel in addressing the problem in a timely manner.

- **Monitoring Dashboard**

  The platform features a modernized monitoring dashboard management function, providing a more user-friendly visual configuration experience compared to traditional Grafana. By offering a unified monitoring view, it aggregates and displays various monitoring metric data, helping users quickly build the required monitoring dashboards.

## Alert Notifications

- **Alert Strategies**

  The platform provides comprehensive alerting capabilities, supporting the configuration of alert rules based on metrics, logs, and events. With a rich set of built-in monitoring metrics and alert templates, users can rapidly configure alert strategies that align with business needs, enabling timely detection and resolution of issues.

- **Alert Templates**

  Alert templates standardize and encapsulate alert rules and notification strategies, supporting rapid reuse across multiple monitoring targets. Template-based configuration significantly reduces the management costs of alert strategies and enhances operational efficiency.

- **Alert History**

  The system fully records the lifecycle of alerts, including trigger time, recovery time, alert status, alert level, and alert content. Users can trace and analyze issues through alert history, continuously optimizing alert configurations.

- **Notifications**

  The platform supports multiple alert notification channels, including email, DingTalk, WeChat Work, Feishu, and Webhook, ensuring that alert information reaches the relevant personnel promptly. Users can flexibly configure notification strategies based on actual needs.

## Call Chain

The distributed call chain query function provides full-link tracing capabilities for microservice architectures. By collecting metadata of inter-service calls, it helps users quickly locate issues in cross-service calls.

## Log Events

- **Logs**

  The platform automatically collects and centrally manages standard output and file logs from clusters, nodes, and containers. It provides powerful log storage, retrieval, and analysis capabilities, supporting multi-dimensional log queries and visual displays, helping users quickly pinpoint issues.

- **Events**

  The platform collects critical event information in real-time from Kubernetes clusters, recording the complete process of resource state changes. When exceptions occur in clusters, nodes, Pods, etc., events can be traced to pinpoint root causes, significantly enhancing issue resolution efficiency.

## Inspection

- **Inspection**

  Drawing on extensive enterprise-level operational experience, the platform offers automated inspection capabilities. Through multi-dimensional health checks, it helps users monitor resource operational statuses in real-time, detect potential risks early, and reduce manual inspection costs.

- **Platform Health Status**

  An intuitive overview of the platform's functional health status is provided, supporting the view of deployment conditions and component operational statuses. Users with platform management permissions can delve into detailed health check data, quickly locating and resolving platform-level issues.
